`<!-- pb_fixme -->`{=html}

This textbook is intended for use in laboratory-centered physics courses
for prospective and practicing elementary and middle school teachers. By
exploring physical phenomena in class, participants learn science in
ways in which they are expected to teach science. The emphasis is upon
questioning, predicting, exploring, observing, discussing, reading, and
writing about what one thinks and why.

This textbook also is appropriate for use in general science courses
that explore some of the physical phenomena underlying global climate
change. In addition, organizations such as museums, youth groups, or
senior citizen programs may find one or more units a feasible framework
for offering extended science learning experiences to the public during
workshops and/or special events. Some of the activities also could form
the basis for on-going exhibits.

The text assumes that the participants will be working at tables in
small groups rather than sitting in rows listening to lectures. However,
the course has been adapted for remote learning. Most of the equipment
involves everyday materials available in homes, schools, and offices.
Regular bulb thermometers can be substituted for the digital temperature
probes described in the text. Participants can use a cell phone app to
measure reflectivity if they do not have light sensors. Â Those without
access to motion detectors can use the graphs provided in the text to
learn about the phenomena explored with these devices.

The level of mathematics required assumes proficiency in mathematics
taught in K-8 classrooms. Also assumed is the willingness to strengthen
some high school mathematics skills as needed. These include using the
geometry of similar triangles, interpreting the heights and slopes of
line graphs, and solving linear algebraic equations.

### A. Unit Structure

::: {.textbox .exercises}
### Each unit follows the same structure:

-   **Identifying resources** participants bring to the study of a topic
    from their prior experiences.
-   **Developing central ideasÂ **based on evidence from exploring
    physical phenomena with everyday equipment and materials.
-   **Using these central ideas to explain intriguing physical
    phenomena**.
-   **Developing mathematical representationsÂ **of the phenomena.
-   **Using these mathematical representations to estimate aÂ quantity of
    interest**.
-   **Making connections to educational policy and the USÂ *Next
    Generation Science StandardsÂ *(NGSS Lead States, 2013)**.
:::

By central ideas, we mean understandings about physical phenomena that
students develop while making sense of their observations. These ideas
emerge from the students' discussions with one another as well as with
the instructor. These central ideas also are powerful ideas because they
form conceptual models useful in describing and explaining the phenomena
explored. The units also develop expertise in generating and
interpreting multiple representations of phenomena such as sketches,
geometric figures, line graphs, and algebraic equations.

**The theme for the course is:***What happens when light from the Sun
shines on the Earth?* The first unit focuses on the nature of light
phenomena. Students explore questions such as how light travels from a
source, what affects the size and shape of shadows, how pinhole cameras
work, how light reflects from both smooth and rough surfaces, and what
happens when light shines through materials such as water and prisms?
Students develop central ideas based on evidence from exploring these
phenomena and use these understandings to think about what causes
rainbows.

When light from the Sun shines on the Earth, things often get hot, so
the second unit explores the nature of thermal phenomena. Why, for
example, do some things feel hot or cold, how is energy conserved when
mixing hot and cold water, and what happens when ice melts, liquid water
warms, and then boils?

The third unit considers the influence of light and thermal phenomena on
the water cycle and local weather. Students develop central ideas about
forms of energy transfer such as radiation, reflection, absorption,
conduction, and convection. They also explore properties of materials
such as thermal conductivity and specific heat. They then use these
ideas to explain weather phenomena. In particular, students develop
explanations for why, after a sunny day at the beach, the sand is hot,
water cool, and cloudy skies often occur along with sea breezes in the
afternoon.

The fourth unit considers the influence of light and thermal phenomena
on global climate (van Zee, Roberts, & Grobart, 2016). Questions include
what happens to energy from the sun as it gets reflected or absorbed by
the oceans, land forms, and atmosphere? What is the greenhouse effect
and how does it modulate global temperatures? Students review websites
presenting climate change indicators in the US, social issues, military
issues, and ways to take action. They also review websites presenting
local, state, national, and international efforts to understand and
address concerns about changes in the global climate. As part of this
unit, the students also explore motion to think about how to interpret
graphical representations of changing phenomena-- where something is,
its position or current value; how that position or value is changing,
its speed or rate of change; and how its speed is changing, its
acceleration, where the 'it' may be a car speeding up but also could be
the mass of melting glaciers all over the Earth.

The fifth unit extends throughout the course. On-going observations of
the Sun and theÂ Moon provide evidence for thinking about why day and
night occur, why the Moon seems to have different shapes at different
times, and why many places on the Earth experience different seasons at
different times of year. Excerpts from writings by Galileo, Newton, and
other scientists provide insights into the history of thoughts about the
Earth's place in the Universe. Explorations throughout the course also
provide contexts for reflecting upon the nature of science as well as
upon the nature of science learning and teaching.

Each unit ends by making connections to educational policy, such as
recommendations articulated in the USÂ *Next Generation Science
Standards* (NGSS Lead States, 2013). In particular, students reflect
upon ways in which their explorations and developing understandings
exemplify the science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts,
and disciplinary core ideas presented in this document.

### **B. Class Sessions** {style="text-align: center"}

This textbook can support classroom-based, hybrid, and online courses.
Our course meets twice a week for 2.5 hours each session for ten weeks.
The supplementary materials may be used to extend instruction for a
semester.Â Class sessions include documenting initial knowledge,
exploring phenomena, recording progress during explorations, discussing
interpretations, writing to solidify understandings, and closing by
reflecting upon what learned and what one is still wondering.

#### *1.Â Identifying Student Resources* {style="text-align: center"}

Each unit begins with a diagnostic question to which students respond in
order to document what they already know about some aspect of the
phenomena they will be exploring. Some diagnostic questions require
drawing and/or writing responses individually. Others involve small
group conversations and brief presentations to the whole group.
Responses to these diagnostic questions are not graded.

Diagnostic questions alert students to the context of upcoming
explorations; they alert the instructor to prevalent ideas on which the
students can build as well as to those that may need refining. Many
initial ideas are reasonable within everyday circumstances rather than
misconceptions that need to be corrected. The notion that a force is
necessary to keep something moving, for example, is reasonable when
thinking about everyday experiences in pushing objects along rough
surfaces. Refining that notion involves considering the effect of
different surfaces on the force needed; less force is needed to keep
something moving at the same speed on smooth surfaces such as ice. If no
friction with the surface and no air resistance occurs, no force is
needed to keep something moving at the same speed in the same direction.
Recognizing such conditions of applicability is an important aspect of
learning physics. Instead of memorizing Newton's first law with a shrug
as a counterintuitive abstraction impossible to believe, students can
understand it as a sensible statement, that a moving object stays in
motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon
by an unbalanced force.

Responding to diagnostic questions can activate *resourcesÂ *from prior
experiences that students can build upon in thinking about and exploring
physical phenomena. The focus on reflecting upon one's own learning in
this course also activates *epistemological resources*, from prior
experiences that students can build upon in thinking about and exploring
learning phenomena (Hammer & Elby, 2003). Students respond to some
diagnostic questions again later in the course, compare their initial
and current responses, and write about their learning processes with
evidence drawn from their initial and current responses to support their
claims.Â In an on-campus course, such diagnostic questions have been
initially asked on handouts that students completed in class. The
instructor collected, viewed, and stored the responses until returning
them after students had completed handouts documenting their current
understandings near the end of the course. In the remote learning
setting, the students responded in class to ungraded surveys, both
initially and near the end of the course. Both responses were accessed
and stored electronically.

#### *2.Â Exploring Phenomena* {style="text-align: center"}

The units focus on doing and interpreting explorations of phenomena in
class. Most equipment can be found in everyday settings such as
kitchens, playrooms, and offices. Some activities and assignments assume
students have access to a computer and to the Internet both inside and
outside of class.Â Suggestions in the text reflect our setting of a
classroom with tables at which small groups work together. Online
students could collaborate in small groups via their course's electronic
network or in breakout rooms. It would be best for interested
individuals not enrolled in a course to explore phenomena with friends
and/or family members rather than alone, but access to a variety of
perspectives will be possible through reading the example student
findings and interpretations.

The text presents the explorations as numbered ***QuestionsÂ ***with
bulleted statements that suggest what to do. These directions are not
intended, however, to be handed out in class. The expectation instead is
that the instructor will pose these general questions, provide the small
groups with equipment needed, and offer some initial oral suggestions
that the students see what they can find out by using the equipment to
explore the phenomena. This open-ended format encourages active student
engagement in designing explorations and interpreting findings.

This instructional approach assumes active engagement by the instructor
and assistants as well. We recommend arranging for one or more graduates
of the course to serve as learning assistants (LAs) for independent
study credit or for stipends if department funding is available. Physics
majors interested in teaching careers also have served as LAs for us as
well as graduate students as teaching assistants (TAs). The instructor
and such assistants circulate among the tables, listen in to what group
members are saying, observe what the students are drawing or doing, and
then ask a question or offer a comment only as needed to help a group to
make progress. This process proved difficult in the remote learning
setting as one cannot monitor what is happening across multiple groups
while assisting one group. It is important to listen first to what is
happening when joining a breakout room before intervening, or not.

A staff member may simply ask a small group "what are you doing?" to
initiate a conversation that encourages students to clarify for
themselves whether what they are doing and thinking makes sense in
moving toward whatever is the goal. The staff member may follow up
withÂ "why are you doing that?" and/or "how is that helping you?" Such
gentle guidance is essential for nudging groups along while also
providing opportunities for students to design and undertake inquiries
in ways that interest them. Alan Schoenfeld (1992) suggests asking these
questions to help students avoid going down unproductive paths in
solving mathematics problems. Such questions also can help students
learn how to monitor their own progress eventually in designing,
conducting, and interpreting explorations.

#### *3.Â Recording Progress During Explorations* {style="text-align: center"}

Keeping track of what one is doing and thinking is important. In our
course, students use a template for a physics notebook page on which to
record their notes during class. When students submit homework
assignments, the instructor may ask them to submit these notebook pages
as well, perhaps for a grade or just to get a sense of how students are
doing. This textbook assumes students are using this physics notebook
page but instructors may prefer to have other ways for students to
document what they are doing and thinking in class.

The recommended physics notebook page is for students to use to keep
track of what they are doing and thinking during explorations:

*BeforeÂ *starting their exploration, their observations and thoughts
about what they are observing *DuringÂ *their exploration, and relevant
*Vocabulary*.

::: {.textbox .examples}
### Example: Front of Physics Notebook Page

**Topic:** State the focus of the exploration: what question(s) are you
asking?

**Before column**. Before starting your exploration, think about and
discuss with your group members what you know already about this topic,
how you plan to conduct the exploration and what you think you might
find out. Record these initial ideas in the "Before" column. Draw
pictures to represent your plans and predictions.

**During column**. During your exploration, record what is happening,
what you observe, and what you are thinking about what you are
observing. Include sketches of equipment and observations. Confirm or
disconfirm predictions and describe some possible next steps.

**Vocabulary**. Note any words that are new and their definitions.
:::

Sections on the back page refer to what happens after collecting data
and recording these findings. These sections include *Central
IdeasÂ *that emerge from interpreting findings, the *Relevant Evidence*
on which you are basing those ideas, the *RationaleÂ *that justifies how
the evidence supports the claims being made with these ideas, a
*ReflectionÂ *about the exploration, and *What* you are *Still
Wondering*.

::: {.textbox .examples}
### Example: Back of Physics Notebook Page

**After**: **CentralÂ Ideas.Â **After your exploration, record any central
ideas that have emerged from your observations and discussions.

**After: Relevant Evidence.** Also note the evidence on which you have
based these ideas.

**After: Rationale.** State explicitly how the evidence is relevant and
supports the claims you are making in stating the central ideas. Also
explain why this result is important.

**After: Reflection.** Then write a reflection about whatever you want
to remember about this experience -- perhaps how what you learned
connects to other experiences, how you learned what you learned, and
what implications these findings might suggest for the next exploration
or for teaching this topic in your own classroom.

**After: Wonderings.Â **In addition, briefly state what you are still
wondering in this context.
:::

Our students make copies of the template of the two-sided physics
notebook page, punch holes in the copies, and use a 3-ring binder in
which they store the notebook pages and handouts. They bring copies of
the physics notebook page to class to use during explorations.
Â Instructors may prefer to recommend other processes for documenting
explorations in this course.

Entries on the physics notebook pages in class serve as notes for
writing a coherent summary of **questions, initial thoughts and plans,
findings, and interpretations** as a laboratory report after class. For
the most effective learning experience, students complete explorations
and summaries before reading the example student findings and
interpretations included in the online text.

Adam Devitt designed these physics notebook pages when he was assisting
in this course. He was a special education elementary school teacher
enrolled in a graduate program in science education. He based his design
of these physics notebook pages by analogy with "before, during, and
after" reading strategies that enhance literacy learning (Devitt, 2010;
Winegrad & Devitt, 2009). The pages have been slightly modified with the
addition of a *RationaleÂ *section and revision of some of the
suggestions in the template with explanations of the various sections.

#### *4. Discussing Interpretations of Findings* {style="text-align: center"}

Initial discussions interpreting findings occur in the small groups. It
is important, however, for the whole group to come to consensus on what
the observations were and what these findings mean. There should be a
clear articulation of one or more central ideas that emerge from the
exploration, the evidence upon which the claims are based, and the
rationale that discusses how the evidence supports the claims and why
this result is important. This coming to a shared understanding about
what happened and what one can infer from the findings can occur through
small group presentations and/or instructor facilitated whole-group
discussions.

Small group presentations maximize the involvement of individual
students in developing interpretations and ways to present these
interpretations to the whole group. Students need to plan and rehearse
how every member of the group will contribute to what they are reporting
about their findings and interpretations. If the small groups have been
exploring the same phenomena in different ways, suggesting a different
focus to different groups will help multiple small group presentations
remain interesting and informative.

As small groups are working on their presentations, the instructor and
assistants visit each group briefly to look at what the students are
putting on a poster (large whiteboard) and to listen to what each
student is planning to say. This way the instructor and assistants can
help shape what the students choose to present and address any issues
that need refining. The group members should include the process of
resolving any such issues as part of their presentation.

Facilitating whole group discussions involves listening to what students
say, welcoming contributions from a variety of individuals, and
encouraging student/student interactions. One way to encourage student
questioning is to paraphrase what someone just said and wait before
saying anything more. Listening to statements puts students into a
conversationally appropriate position to ask a question. If the
instructor waits without responding to that question, another student
may venture an answer, which may prompt yet another student to risk
offering a contribution to the thinking (van Zee & Minstrell, 1997).
Although time-consuming, such vigorous student/student discussions can
create a meaningful context for students to make sense of their findings
before leaving class.

It is important for the instructor to resist the temptation to present a
quick coherent summary of what was to be learned. If this occurs
frequently, students tend to wait for it and not engage as well in
making their own sense of what has happened.Â The extent to which the
instructor feels compelled to 'tell answers' likely will vary, however,
with the time to the end of class, the importance of the current topic
to later topics, the apparent engagement of the students, and everyone's
patience. We believe that the more group members can generate their own
ideas, resolve puzzles themselves, and develop coherent arguments
supporting their claims, the more they will learn.

Fostering small group presentations and/or whole group conversation near
the close of the students' explorations is an important step in helping
to clarify and refine understandings. Such presentations and
conversations also will help students develop the skills in
argumentation advocated in the USÂ *Next Generation Science
StandardsÂ *(Lead States, 2013). The intent is for the students to be the
ones who articulate emergent central ideas, state relevant evidence, and
provide rationales to explain how that evidence supports the claims
being made and why the result is important.

Similar interpretative processes occur during subsequent sessions when
students use the central ideas developed previously in order to explain
intriguing phenomena that they have just explored, to develop
mathematical representations of the phenomena, and/or to use these
mathematical representations to estimate a quantity of interest.

#### *5. Writing toÂ * *solidify* *Â understandings* {style="text-align: center"}

Scheduling time near the end of class for students to write about what
they have understood helps solidify understandings about the physical
phenomena explored and the learning that occurred during the session.
Sometimes this can be an open-ended opportunity to reflect on what seems
most interesting and/or important to the students but often the
instructor may choose to provide some structure such as a table to
complete, a drawing to be made, or a prompt for a summary statement.
Many of the optional handouts provide such structure. These efforts do
not need to be collected nor graded. They are intended to be the
beginnings for students to write a coherent summary prepared at home.

#### *6. Reflecting Upon What Learned and What Still Wondering* {style="text-align: center"}

At the close of class, members of each small group reflect together upon
what they have just learned in class, write a brief statement of what
was most interesting to them, and articulate a question that expresses
what they are still wondering. They record these thoughts briefly on
*exit tickets* that the small groups turn in as they leave class. In the
remote learning setting, the students responded individually to ungraded
surveys with the essay questions *What was most interesting about what
you learned today*Â and *What are you still wondering*. This provided
immediate feedback to the instructor, which was very helpful in becoming
aware of issues that students might otherwise have not expressed.

If a member of each group reports orally to the whole group, students
also hear what others have learned and are still wondering. These brief
reflections often provide insights into what was puzzling and needs
clarification, next steps that might not otherwise have been
contemplated, and practical matters that need attention. Sometimes the
students' questions get the whole class thinking about the next
exploration! Although time-consuming, such oral as well as written
reflections can foster a sense of community and enrich the wonderings as
well as the understandings with which students leave the classroom.

This practice was inherited from Dr. John Layman, a physics professor
who taught a similar physics course at the University of Maryland
College Park. One of his graduates strongly recommended continuing this
closing ceremony as she had found it very meaningful. Apparently some of
our graduates feel this way as well as several have reported choosing to
continue this practice with their own elementary students.

The instructor can indicate sections of the online text that are
relevant to the explorations undertaken during that class and/or to some
of the questions just raised. Many of the students' questions will not
be addressed in this course, however. It is important to acknowledge
such questions as an aspect of doing science. Scientists frequently
generate intriguing questions that they cannot immediately explore
within their current research. Generating questions about whatever one
is doing and thinking can become a helpful practice no matter in what
field of endeavor one is engaged.

After class, we have posted the relevant sections of the text online.
Earlier access to the text may inhibit student learning. We believe that
students will learn more, as well as build confidence and competence in
doing science, if they use the online text as a means for confirming
understandings that they have already developed themselves through their
explorations and discussions in class.

</div>

### **C.** Assignments {style="text-align: center"}

As is typical in physics courses, assignments include solving a variety
of word problems related to the physical phenomena explored in class.
The students also report their ongoing observations of the Sun and the
Moon on a weekly basis. These form the evidence later in the term for
developing explanatory models of day and night, the phases of the Moon,
and the Earth's seasons.

Assignments also emphasize integrating science and literacy learning,
such as speaking clearly, listening closely, writing coherently, reading
with comprehension, and creating and critiquing information provided
through electronic media (van Zee et al., 2013a,b). As prospective
teachers, our students create a children's book based on their
explorations in class. They also make connections in each unit to the US
*Next Generation Science Standards* (NGSS Lead States, 2013) adopted by
many departments of education.

Suggested assignments also include engaging friends and family members
in learning about the phenomena that students just explored in class
(Crowl et al., 2013). Such assignments can enhance the students'
confidence in teaching science as well as contribute to educating
citizens about the nature of science as well as about the evidence
underlying concerns about climate change. The students write reflections
about what happened, what the learner(s) asked, said, did, and found,
and what they learned about science learning and teaching. By posting
these reflections on an electronic discussion board, they can learn from
one another's experiences.

The students also reflect upon their learning processes, how they are
making sense out of what they are learning each week, what aspects they
want to remember, and what questions they still have. These reflections
also are helpful for alerting the instructor to issues that need to be
addressed and for suggesting ways to connect topics in the course to the
students' interests.

Readings include articles by teachers reflecting upon exploring similar
phenomena with their students as well as internet resources relevant to
phenomena explored in class. The suggestedÂ *before, during,Â *and *after
reading strategies* (Winegard and Devitt, 2009) are shown
**[here](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/a7regl2rnvyx503vmcuvbkc2uob2aiyp)Â **(docx)
orÂ **[here](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/qf51reenul5bqx6obiwln0vhp9qzunj2)Â **(pdf).

The students access and critique internet resources relevant to
university, state, national, and international efforts to address issues
related to global climate change. They also explore websites presenting
climate change indicators, social issues, military issues, and ways to
take action. Â The expectation is that students will read enough to
become aware of such resources and to find something interesting to
report; they are not expected to read these materials in depth.

Students submit printed homework and reading assignments in class; some
instructors prefer submission through an electronic platform
(Canvas).Â Midterm and final examinations complete these formal
assessments of students' learning. Currently the midterm is a 'sit down'
affair during a class session where students can use their notebooks
(but not their cell phones) for up to the full 2.5 hours of class if
needed. The final currently involves preparing at home a file with
responses to the questions and submitting this file online. Some of the
questions include comparing students' responses on the same diagnostic
questions early and late in the course and discussing how they learned
what they learned based on the evidence provided by these responses.

### D. Equipment {style="text-align: center"}

This course is laboratory-centered, which means every session involves
some kind of exploration. Most of the equipment involves everyday
materials found in homes, schools, and offices such as toilet and paper
towel rolls, aluminum foil, wax paper, cardboard, flashlights, pots, hot
plates, jars, plastic containers, etc. The Instructor's Guide includes a
detailed list, or you can find it
[here](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/8ej6vy1opvja5nqqrrgotlo404myj48y).
Access to the internet is assumed inside and outside of class. Usually
at least one member of a small group has a computer laptop that can be
brought to class. We use three digital probes:

1.  A light probe (TI light probe,
    [https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/tilt-bta/,Â ](https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/tilt-bta)\$16
    with Go-Link interface (\$69).
2.  A temperature probe (Go!Temp,
    [http://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/temperature-sensors/go-temp/](http://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/temperature-sensors/go-temp),
    \$39).
3.  A motion detector ( Go!Motion,
    [http://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/motion-detectors/go-mot/](http://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/motion-detectors/go-mot),
    \$124).

Each group uses 1 light probe, 2 temperature probes, and 1 motion
detector. If necessary, the instructor can use only one motion detector
with the entire class. Regular bulb and tube thermometers can be used
rather than the digital temperature probes. The students can use a cell
phone app for measuring reflectivity rather than a light probe. The text
also includes screen shots of the relevant graphs so that students
without access to digital equipment can still think about the topics
addressed. They will miss, however, the wonderful learning experiences
these devises can provide.

### E. Connection to US *Next Generation Science Standards* {style="text-align: center"}

### Acknowledgements {style="text-align: center"}

We deeply appreciate the encouragement of Professor Henri Jansen in the
design and implementation of this course when he was chair of the
Physics Department. Professor Kenneth Winegrad, a literacy faculty
member in the College of Education, contributed many helpful insights to
our endeavors to integrate science and literacy learning in this course.
This open-source textbook includes work supported earlier by the
National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0633752-DUE, *Integrating
Physics and Literacy Learning in a Physics Course for Elementary and
Middle School Teachers.* Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or
recommendations expressed in this material are those of the grantees and
do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.

Two papers describe this effort to integrate science and literacy
learning in a physics course for prospective teachers (van Zee, Jansen,
Winegrad, Crowl, & Devitt (2013a, b). Another describes ways we later
included global climate change issues (van Zee, Roberts, & Grobart,
2016). Professor Winegrad and Adam Devitt, a graduate assistant who was
an experienced elementary special education teacher, developed a handout
describing before, during, and after reading strategies for use in the
course (Winegrad & Devitt, 2009). Adam also created the before, during,
and after design of the Physics Notebook Page in analogy to those
reading strategies. In addition, he documented literacy activities he
initiated in the course (Devitt, 2010). Michele Crowl, a graduate
assistant who was a former science museum educator, invented the friends
and family assignments (Crowl, Devitt, Jansen, van Zee, & Winegrad,
2013). Katie Kizer, an undergraduate peer instructor, created a website
documenting the course at

.](http://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/physics/coursewikis/ph111/doku81aa.html?id=start)

Many of the suggested readings were written by teachers participating in
NSF No. MDR-9155726, *Investigation of Questioning Processes during
Conversations about Science*, Emily H. van Zee, PI, University of
California-Berkeley; NSF No. 9986846, *Case Studies of Elementary
Student Inquiry in Physical Science,* David Hammer, PI; Emily van Zee,
co-PI, University of Maryland College Park; and a series of small grants
from the Spencer Foundation under the Practitioner Research program,
including *Fostering Teachers' Inquiries into Science Learning*, Emily
H. van Zee, PI, University of Maryland, College Park. Participating
teachers included Mary Bell (2006), Claire Bove (2007), Kathleen Hogan
(2007), Christopher Horne (2007), Marletta Iwaysk (1997), Akiko Kurose
(2000), Diantha Lay (2000), Jamie Mikeska (2006), Constance Nissley

We have been very fortunate to have had excellent mentors and many
opportunities to participate in and/or to learn about research and
curriculum development projects while teaching and learning science with
preschoolers, school children, undergraduates, graduate students,
teachers, and the public, inside and outside of formal settings:

The first author, Emily van Zee, would like to thank Professor Gerald
Holton for introducing her to the community of physicists who care about
teaching when she worked for him as a research and editorial assistant
during the early years of *Project Physics* (Holton, 2003; Rutherford,
Holton, & Watson, 1971). She enjoyed learning not only about ways to
engage students in exploring physical phenomena but also about
historical, philosophical, and cultural aspects of the development of
physics principles. The importance of providing access to such broader
views underlies her inclusion of aspects of these perspectives in this
*Exploring Physical Phenomena* open-source textbook.

Betty Roald, a talented elementary school teacher, welcomed the first
author, as a stay-at-home Mom, to teach science to wiggly first grade
students. The first author remembers sitting on the floor with the
children around her while engaging them in explorations suggested in a
book about how bodies work (Allison, 1976). Similar volunteer
experiences with young children and older scouts in both formal and
informal settings prompted her later support of a graduate assistant's
initiative in inventing the friends and family assignments, now a
regular part of our course (Crowl et al., 2013). The first author
learned about the Moon from Leslie DeWater, a talented fifth grade
teacher as well as master teacher in the University of Washington's
physics programs for teachers.

The first author also would like to thank Professor Arnold Arons (1972,
1977) and Professor Lillian C. McDermott (1993, 2016) for changing the
way she teaches. The first author joined the Physics 101-102, 103 staff
at the University of Washington when it was the setting for the
development of the *Physics by Inquiry* curriculum (McDermott, 1990;
McDermott and the Physics Education Group, 1996; McDermott, Rosenquist,
& van Zee, 1983). Earlier, as a new middle school science teacher, the
first author had taught students in the way she had been taught, by
telling them what she thought they should know. Here, however, she
learned how to teach in a new way, by moving among small groups of
students sitting at tables as they worked together exploring phenomena.
She learned to listen closely to what the students were saying to one
another, to intervene (or not) with a comment or question, and to answer
a question with a question designed to help prompt the next step in
thinking.

Petra Carrera, Rafael Escribano, Gabriel Florentino, Luanna Gomez,
KimBerly Petitt, and Darrell Simms were particularly insightful about
their learning processes as students and/or peer instructors in the
Physics 101 series. The first author's experiences in teaching these
courses motivated the inquiry-based pedagogical approach as well as some
of the light, thermal and astronomy activities that she adapted while
designing and teaching this physics course for prospective teachers.
Also relevant was the emphasis on documenting and interpreting student
learning, such as ways students used multiple representations,
particularly those involving motion graphs (McDermott, Rosenquist, & van
Zee, 1987). In addition, the first author became aware here of the
extensive science curricular resources developed earlier with NSF
support forÂ use with elementary and middle school students (National
Academy of Science, 1996).

With expert guidance from Professor Lee Beach (1990), the first author
undertook studies of cognition and metacognition, particularly in
exploring ways people use information while making decisions (van Zee,
Palunchowski, & Beach, 1992). She also began studies of the ethnography
of communication with Professor Gerry Philipsen (1994) about ways in
which people talk thoughtfully with one another; she was particularly
interested in the role of questioning during such discussions. These
studies contributed to her interest in and awareness of many aspects of
discourse that affect how students think and learn.

The first author enjoyed collaborating with a high school physics
teacher, Jim Minstrell, in documenting and interpreting how he used
questioning to guide student thinking (van Zee & Minstrell, 1997a,b).
Her post-doctoral research focused upon *An Investigation of Questioning
Processes during a Cognitive Approach to Physics InstructionÂ *with
support from the James S. McDonnell Foundation. We found that he asked
questions to help students make their meanings clear, to consider
various points of view in a neutral manner, and to monitor the
discussion and their own thinking. He had developed a computer program,
*Diagnoser,* based on facets of student knowledge that he had identified
through research in his own classroom (Minstrell, 1988, 1992; Minstrell
& Hunt, 1990). The students could work through a series of questions to
diagnose their current thinking; then they could take next steps that
the *Diagnoser* suggested based upon their responses. The diagnostic
questions that begin each unit in this *Exploring Physical Phenomena*
open-source textbook are a similar effort to alert the students and the
instructor to students' initial ideas about a topic, both those useful
for building deeper understandings as well as any needing refinement.
The first author's experiences here deeply influenced her adoption of a
positive instructional perspective of helping students to expand their
areas of competence rather than screening student responses for
misconceptions that need toÂ be corrected.

As an instructor in an innovative combined program for future teachers
and future researchers at the University of California, Berkeley
(Lowery, Schoenfeld, & White, 1990), the first author modeled video
recording her own class sessions to gather data for doing research on
one's own teaching practices and students' learning (van Zee, 2000). She
enjoyed learning more about cognitive science along with her students,
particularly through many conversations with Claire Bove, Ming Chiu,
Miriam Gamoran, Sean Hutcherson, Lawrence Muilenburg, Marcelle Siegel,
and Erica Street as well as with teaching colleagues Stan Fukunaga, Don
Hubbard, and Dan Zimmerman. She learned about causal models from
Professor Barbara White (1993) and about ways to use computers as
learning partners from Professor Marcia Linn(1991). She also learned
from Professor Andy diSessa (1993) about phenomenological primitives
(p-prims), or pieces of knowledge that students may use in generating
responses when asked physics questions. This perspective contrasts with
interpreting students' responses as revealing misconceptions firmly
embedded in students' brains, wrong ideas that need to be elicited,
confronted, and changed. In addition, she learned from Professor Alan
Schoenfeld (1992) about metacognitive processes that help students stay
aware of what they are doing and why. These perspectives underlie this
course's emphasis on explorations to expand and refine the prospective
teachers' understandings of physical phenomena.

With expert mentoring from Professors John Layman, Randy McGinnis, and
Jim Fey, the first author taught courses on methods of teaching science
for prospective elementary and middle school teachers as a faculty
member in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at the University
of Maryland, College Park. She also appreciated the warm welcome by
Professor Joe Redish to activities in the Department of Physics. She
noticed a distinct difference in students who were graduates of Physics
115, a course that served as one of the development sites for the
American Association of Physics Teachers' *Powerful Ideas in Physical
Science* curriculum (American Association of Physics Teachers, 1995;
Ukens, Hein, Johnson, & Layman, 2004). Rather than being bewildered by
her inquiry-based instructional approach, Physics 115 graduates
understood what to do and seemed to enjoy doing it, modeling for their
classmates learning science by working together asking their own
questions and exploring phenomena without detailed step-by-step
directions. The first author enjoyed observing the Physics 115 course
occasionally. She chose to adapt some light and thermal activities from
this resource.

Collaboration with Professor David Hammer and a group of practicing
elementary and middle school teachers broadened the first author's
vision of what teaching science through inquiry can mean. Developed
under NSF-9986846, *Case Studies of Elementary Student Inquiry in
Physical Science* included engaging the teachers in learning physics
during the summer as well as in documenting and interpreting their
students' science thinking during the academic year (Hammer & van Zee,
2006). The emphasis was on recognizing and refining epistemological
resources as well as initial science understandings (Hammer, 2000;
Hammer & Elby, 2003). In teaching the physics course for prospective
elementary and middle school teachers and preparing this open-source
textbook, the first author drew on many of these experiences in the
context of exploring light phenomena (van Zee, Hammer, Bell, Roy, &
Peter, 2006).

Participating in the Carnegie Academy for the Scholarship of Teaching
and Learning (Shulman, 2002) increased the first author's proficiency in
video recording her own instructional practices and in writing
interpretations of her students' thinking and learning. She also
encouraged her students and graduates of her courses to document and
interpret their own teaching practices and students' thinking and
learning (van Zee, Lay & Roberts, 2003). This emphasis on focused
reflection, based on evidence collected in class, underlies the
extensive use of students' writing in preparation of this open source
textbook.

The first author was invited to design this physics course for
prospective elementary and middle school teachers after retiring from
the University of Maryland and moving to Corvallis, Oregon. She deeply
appreciates the welcome by Professors Larry Flick and Larry Enochs and
the opportunity to collaborate with Rebekah Elliot, Nam Hwa Kang, and
Janice Rosenberg in the Department of Science and Mathematics Education
at Oregon State University. She learned a lot about teaching mathematics
and using technology Â during a series of collaborations with Professor
Maggie Niess.

The first author would like to thank Professor Fred Goldberg for his
thoughtful encouragement as she grew more confident in teaching physics
in interactive ways. The process of developing explanations in *Physics
and Everyday Thinking* (Goldberg, Robinson, & Otero, 2007; Goldberg,
Otero, & Robinson, 2010; Goldberg, Price, Robinson, Boyd-Harlow, &
McKean, 2012) influenced the first author's design of assignments in
this course. In starting to work on a physics problem, for example,
students review the conceptual model they have developed for the
relevant physical phenomenon before attending to the specific
information provided. The *Physics and Everyday Thinking* curriculum's
explicit emphasis on learning about learning as well as learning about
physics also influenced our attention to engaging students in developing
pedagogical as well as physical science understandings as integral to
class activities, homework assignments, and examinations.

The second author, Elizabeth Gire, also enjoyed talking with Professor
Goldberg about interactive engagement strategies while he was teaching a
course for prospective teachers with the *Physics and Everyday Thinking*
curriculum. In addition, she was mentored by Charles De Leone in
teaching an adaptation of CLASP (*Collaborative Learning through Active
Sense-Making in Physics*), a course that supports students in building
understanding by making observations, working in small groups to
generate ideas, presenting those ideas to the rest of the class, and
whole class discussion of those ideas (Potter, Webb, Paul, West, Bowen,
Weiss, & De Leone, 2014). During that time, she studied how students'
success on physics problems correlated with their use of non-algebraic
representations (graphs, diagrams, etc) to make sense of physical
situations and to communicate their understanding (DeLeone and E. Gire,
2006).Â Since then, her teaching and research has focused both on how
students engage in physics sensemaking and how they use different
representations to make sense of physical systems (Gire, Nguyen, &
Rebello, 2011; Gire & Price, 2015; Hahn, Emigh, Lenz, & Gire, 2017).

Now a physics faculty member at Oregon State University, the second
author is the current instructor for our physics course for prospective
teachers and has been enriching this effort to create the *Exploring
Physical Phenomena* open-source textbook. Her research focuses upon ways
in which to engage students in seeking coherence among different
representations of physics knowledge. She and her colleagues are
developing a set of hands-on, discovery-style, discussion-based
classroom activities that use dry-erasable three-dimensional plastic
surfaces to represent physical systems that depend on multiple variables
(Gire, 2017; Gire, A. Wangberg & R. Wangberg, 2018).

The second author also is developing a physics course for majors that
explicitly engages students in developing knowledge of sense-making
strategies, metacognitive skills, and productive beliefs about the
nature of doing physics as well as in increasing their awareness and
appreciation of physics sense-making processes (Gire, Emigh, Hahn, and
Lenz, 2018). Her explicit focus on such physics education research
contributes to her positive pedagogical approach in meeting the needs of
the prospective elementary and middle school teachers, many of whom seem
to perceive themselves initially as reluctant science learners. She has
introduced circle conversations, for example, in which the small groups
gather to share their findings, sometimes through multiple iterations of
thoughtful discussions, until they come to consensus on their
interpretations of what they have observed.

Both authors have enjoyed collaborating with Professor Corinne Manogue
in the physics department's on-going research and curriculum development
in the context of upper division courses for physics majors, *Paradigms
in Physics* (Gire, Kustusch, & Manogue, 2012; Gire & Manogue, 2011;
Manogue, Cerny, Gire, Mountcastle, Price, & van Zee, 2010; Manogue,
Gire, & Roundy, 2013; Manogue & Krane, 2003; van Zee & Manogue, 2010,
2018). These courses are unusual in their organization of the physics
content studied as well as in their use of interactive engagement
strategies in class. Although the level of mathematics and conceptual
content in the course for prospective teachers is different, the
emphasis on encouraging students to enjoy learning with and from one
another is similar. We both have grown in pedagogical as well as physics
knowledge through our participation in the *Paradigms in Physics*
program.

We are deeply grateful to the colleagues who have educated and
encouraged us. We also haveÂ greatly appreciated the care and thoughtful
assistance from Stefanie Buck, Dianna Fisher, Kenya Hazell, Baylee
Bullock, Derek Ostrom, and Mark Lane of OSU Open Educational Resources.
Our families have been wonderfully supportive of this endeavor. However,
any errors in these materials are our own. Please email us at

This course is intended for prospective and practicing elementary and
middle school teachers. By exploring physical phenomena in class, you
will learn science in ways in which you are expected to teach science in
schools or in informal settings such as afterschool programs, youth
group meetings, and museum workshops. This course also is appropriate
for general science students and others interested in exploring some of
the physical phenomena underlying global climate change.

The theme for the course is: *What happens when light from the Sun
shines on the Earth?* The emphasis is on questioning, predicting,
exploring, observing, discussing, reading, and writing about what one
thinks and why. This first unit focuses on exploring the nature of light
phenomena. Among the unit's many goals are two primary ones: to learn
about light phenomena and to learn about ways to foster science learning
for yourself and others such as your family, friends, and students.

What does it mean to "explore the nature of light phenomena"? You will
be:

-   ***identifying resources*** such as positive experiences you already
    have had in learning about light and
-   ***developing central ideas based on evidence*** that you record
    while exploring everyday phenomena such as light and shadows.

By central ideas, we mean understandings about physical phenomena that
emerge from your discussions with your group members as well as with the
instructor. These also are powerful ideas because they form conceptual
models usefulÂ in:

-   ***explaining an intriguing phenomenon*** such as what happens when
    you look through a pinhole camera, something most find surprising,
    yet even children can understand.

After developing conceptual understandings of the relevant physics
principles, you will be:

-   ***developing mathematical representations*** of this phenomenon and
    using these when
-   ***estimating a quantity of interest***, such as the diameter of the
    Sun.

Throughout the course you will be reflecting upon ways that are helping
you learn science. In reflecting upon this learning process, you will
be:

-   ***making connections to educational policy***, such as the *Next
    Generation Science Standards* (NGSS Lead States, 2013). This
    document has been adopted by many departments of education as the
    science standards for grades K-12 in the United States.

Other light phenomena that you will be exploring during this unit
include reflection, refraction, and dispersion. You will develop
additional central ideas based upon these explorations; then use this
expanded conceptual model for light to explain another intriguing but
more complex phenomenon: rainbows.

Because K-8 curricula emphasize learning to read and write well, this
course also models ways to integrate science and literacy learning. By
literacy learning, we mean learning to speak clearly, listen closely,
write coherently, read with comprehension, and create and critique
media.

The main sections present questions with suggestions for exploring
topics and for writing reflections about your findings. The text in gray
font indicates that these are suggestions; you may think of better ways
to explore the topic. You are encouraged to ask and explore your own
questions about light phenomena as well as those posed here. Check with
your instructor if you choose to devise an alternative approach.

Keeping track of what one is doing and thinking is important. This
course uses a physics notebook page that can organize how you record
your notes during class. This physics notebook page can help you
remember your thoughts *before, during,* and *after* an exploration. An
experienced elementary teacher, Adam Devittt, designed this physics
notebook page to mirror the structure of *before, during,* and
*after*Â reading strategies:

[Before]{style="text-decoration: underline"} starting your exploration,
think about and discuss with your group members what you know already
about this topic, how you plan to conduct the exploration, and what you
think you might find out.

[During]{style="text-decoration: underline"} your exploration, record
what is happening, what you are observing, and what you are thinking
about what you are observing. Include sketches of equipment and
observations. Note any words that are new and their definitions.

[After]{style="text-decoration: underline"} your exploration, record any
central ideas that have emerged from your observations and discussions.
Also note the evidence on which you have based these ideas. State
explicitly how the evidence is relevant and supports the claims you are
making in stating the central ideas. Also explain why this result is
important. Then write a reflection about whatever you want to remember
about this experience. In addition, briefly state what you are still
wondering in this context.

After class, use your physics notebook pages and any handouts to write a
summary of your exploration and findings. Writing such a summary after
every class is a good way to prepare for the midterm and final
examinations.

Next, to be sure you have understood the physics involved, read this
text and some examples of student work. The student authors first wrote
drafts, received feedback for ways to enhance content and clarity, and
submitted these final versions. Also read about some nuances to consider
when explaining the phenomena explored.

You may also find helpful student reflections about teaching a friend or
family member about what they had just learned in class, historical
information about ways knowledge about the topic developed, and some
relevant aspects of the nature of science in the context of the topic
explored. These sections of the text may broaden your understanding of
science and of science learning and teaching.

What do you already know about light? When did you learn this? Where
were you? With whom? Why were you interested? How did this learning
occur? These prior experiences in learning about light provide
*resources* upon which you can draw in learning more about light in this
course.

These "question words" --What? When? Where? Who? Why? and How? --
represent an important aspect of science for which you are already
expert in everyday life: asking questions. In this unit, you will
explore questions that you and others generate about science learning in
general and also about learning about light.

### **A. Learning about ways to foster science learning** {#chapter-002-identifying-student-resources.html#U1H31}

Here is the first question:

##### ***Question 1.1 What have you learned about light at some time in your life, inside or outside of school, during an experience when you enjoyed the learning process?*** {#chapter-002-identifying-student-resources.html#U1H51 .no-indent style="text-align: center"}

::: {.textbox}
Equipment for each small group: Use a piece of chart paper, magic
markers (all colors), and some masking tape if there is room on a nearby
wall to display your work.
:::

-   What did you learn about light? How did you learn this? With whom
    were you learning? Where were you doing this learning? When did this
    happen? Why were you enjoying this learning process?

Think about what you may have learned about light in a science class at
school but also consider what you learned outside of school by playing
with flashlights, looking in mirrors, swimming, wearing glasses,
painting, seeing rainbows, sitting by campfires, growing plants,
noticing the moon, watching a sunset, looking up at the stars...

If you are working with a group, share some of these learning
experiences with one another.

-   Choose one of these positive science learning experiences on which
    to focus. Draw a picture of yourself learning about light while
    enjoying the process. This course models integrating art and science
    so make a [large vivid, colorful
    picture]{style="text-decoration: underline"} that will interest
    others.
-   Note the age you were when you were learning this.
-   While drawing a picture of yourself learning about light, think
    about why this experience had 'worked' for you. What had helped you
    learn about light in this instance?
-   Add to your drawing words or phrases that convey some of the ways
    that this experience had helped you learn about light.
-   If you are working with others, introduce yourselves by describing
    your positive experiences learning about light, the ages you were
    when you had these experiences, and some of the ways that these
    experiences had fostered your science learning.
-   Based upon the evidence provided by this process, make a list of
    ways to help someone learn science in the context of learning about
    light.
-   Make a claim about one way to foster such science learning. Support
    your claim with evidence drawn from the positive science learning
    experiences you and others reported.

After completing your exploration of ways to foster such science
learning, look at an example of student work to see how others have
thought about this process.

#### *1. An example of student work identifying resources for fostering science learning* *** *** {#chapter-002-identifying-student-resources.html#U1H41}

On the first day of class, for example, physics students in this course
reflected upon their experiences in learning about light at some time in
their lives, inside or outside of school, when they learned some science
and enjoyed the process. Figure 1.1 shows some examples of positive
science learning experiences that members of one group remembered and
represented with drawings of ways in which they had learned about light.

FIG 1.1 A small group's drawings of enjoyable experiences learning about
light.
:::
:::

A student wrote about looking up at the stars, "didn't understand why
sometimes you would see a bunch of stars and other times you
wouldn't...Remember being amazed when learning about them because they
feel so close but are actually far away." Another student wrote,
"Exciting to see rainbow colors in my hand and not in the sky!...I
thought it was crazy that these bright colors were coming from glass."

This array of experiences, drawn from multiple individuals, provides
evidence upon which one can base claims. As shown in Fig. 1.2, students
identified the following ways that had fostered their science learning:
learning hands-on, access to books/resources, support from families,
education, use of the environment: outdoor, camps, OMSI (Oregon Museum
of Science and Industry), going to museums/planetarium, visual
experiences, doing experiments, and asking questions.

FIG. 1.2 List of ways to foster science learning identified by physics
students.
:::
:::

This list is an example of findings from a qualitative study. The
students based these findings on analyzing data that consisted of
self-reported experiences by multiple individuals. The list forms an
initial framework for thinking about ways to foster science learning.
These ways "worked" for the individuals who generated the list and may
help others learn science too.

The following is an example of a student making a claim and beginning to
construct an argument to support that claim with evidence drawn from an
array of personal experiences:

*Claim: The use of the environment is an important aspect that fosters
science learning.*

*Evidence: During the summertime I used to lay on a sleeping bag in my
backyard with my dad and we would watch the sky. I would spot stars,
planets, the moon, and airplanes flying by. Observing my environment
made me more aware and it got me to ask my dad questions about what was
happening around us. Science is all around us, and using natural
examples makes learning more exciting and more memorable.*

Physics student, Spring 2015

This student began supporting her claim with an example drawn from a
personal experience involving her home and family. Additional examples
could strengthen this claim. Including group member's experiences of
seeing rainbows, for example, could add support to this claim by
illustrating other environmental contexts within which positive science
learning occurred.

Your responses to Question 1.1. recorded some of what you already know
about light and what you already know about ways to foster science
learning. Next you will be documenting what you already know about the
specific aspects of light that you are about to explore.

Question 1.2 is called a *Diagnostic Question* (DQ). Your response to a
Diagnostic Question documents what you already know about a particular
topic. Your response will not be graded.

In this section, you will be developing some central ideas about the
nature of light by playing with light and shadows. Keeping track of what
you are doing and thinking is important.

### **A. Documenting your explorations** {#chapter-003-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-2.html#U1H33}

One way to document what you are doing and thinking is to write an
on-going record in a science notebook. The physics notebook page shown
in Figures 1.3 and 1.4, for example, can help you remember your thoughts
*before, during,* and *after* an exploration. First view the front of
the physics notebook page:

**Topic:** What are you exploring?

**Before column**. Before starting your exploration, discuss with your
group members what you already know about this topic, what ideas you
have, what questions you are asking, how you plan to conduct the
exploration, and what you think you might find out. Record these briefly
in the "Before" column along with any relevant drawings.

**During column**. During your exploration, record what is happening and
what you are thinking about what you are observing. Include sketches of
equipment and observations. Indicate whether you confirm or disconfirm
your predictions and what these findings suggest for next steps.

**Vocabulary**. Note any words that are new and their definitions.

Then view the back of the physics notebook page:

**After**: **CentralÂ Ideas.** After your exploration, record any central
ideas that have emerged from your observations and discussions.

**After: Evidence.** Also note the relevant evidence on which you have
based these ideas.

**After: Rationale.** State explicitly how the evidence is relevant and
supports the claim you are making in stating the central ideas. Also
note why this result is important.

**After: Reflection.** Then write a reflection about whatever you want
to remember about this experience -- perhaps what you have done and
learned, how you learned this, and what implications this experience
might have for teaching this topic in your own classroom...

**After: Wonderings.** In addition, briefly state what you are still
wondering at this point.

Adam Devitt designed these notebook pages when he was assisting in this
course. He was a special education elementary school teacher enrolled in
a graduate program in science education. He based his design of these
physics notebook pages on "before, during, and after" reading strategies
that enhance literacy learning. Some of the entries have been slightly
modified.

### **B. Exploring the nature of light phenomena** {#chapter-003-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-2.html#U1H34}

Asking questions is an important aspect of *doingÂ *science.Â Question 1.3
is a "what happens..." question:

##### ***Question 1.3 What happens when light from a source shines on a screen?*** {#chapter-003-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-2.html#U1H53 style="padding-left: 60px"}

Equipment: a light source in a dark room; a screen such as a large white
board covered with a piece of chart paper

-   Find a dark room in which to explore the nature of light such as a
    room with no windows or a room with windows that have dark shades to
    keep out daylight.

For a vertical *screen*, use a plain white wall or make one by taping a
piece of chart paper on a whiteboard or large piece of cardboard that
you can lean against a stool or box on a table.

For a *light source*, use a lamp without a shade, that has a clear
unfrosted incandescent bulb or a frosted bulb with LEDs.\*

(\*Look at the inside of the incandescent bulb. The narrow wire inside
the bulb is called its *filament.* The filament is made out of a metal
that glows when electricity flows through the lamp.Â LEDs (light emitting
diodes) emit light by a different process that requires much less
energy. Â LEDs have been marketed in a frosted bulb to imitate light from
incandescent bulbs.)

-   Place the lamp near the screen. Figure 1.5 illustrates the set-up.

FIG. 1.5 Predict what you will see when turning on a clear light bulb
near a screen.
:::
:::

-   What will you see on the screen?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Talk with your group members about what you think and why you think
    that.
-   Begin to keep track of what you are doing: At the top of your
    physics notebook page, record the *Topic* of this exploration.
-   Under *Before,* draw a picture of the set up. What do you predict
    will happen? Why do you predict this will happen?
-   Turn on the light bulb in the dark room: what do you see on the
    screen?
-   Under the *During* section of your physics notebook page, record
    what you see and interpret these results.
-   Discuss your findings and formulate a relevant central idea. In the
    *After* section of the physics notebook page, report this idea and
    the evidence on which it is based.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Use this physics notebook page and additional pages as needed to
    keep track of what you are doing and thinking during a series of
    related explorations.

In summarizing this exploration, a student noted, for example:

*The demonstration started with a vertical light bulb being placed in
front of a white piece of paper. We made predictions about what we
thought would happen when the light was turned on in a dark room and I
thought that the light would make a circle on the white paper, which
gets dimmer as the circle gets bigger.*

Some students predict that they would see light in the shape of the
filament on the screen. A student reported:

*When a lamp is turned on in a dark room, light from the lamp shines on
a screen. If the light source is a clear incandescent bulb, the light on
the screen is not limited to the shape of the filament. The area of the
screen directly in front of the lamp may appear brighter than areas of
the screen farther away from the lamp, but all of the screen is lit. In
addition, light from the lamp shines on the ceiling and the other walls
of the room, as well as on the faces of those looking at the lamp and
screen.* *Â *

This suggests a central idea, thatÂ ***light leaves a source in all
directions.*** A student may note, however, that light leaves lasers in
a particular direction. A further refinement involves pondering the use
of *all*, whether one can be sure that light leaves a source inÂ *every*
direction. This suggests thatÂ ***light leaves most light sources in many
directions.***

Â 

Have you ever used your fingers to make shadow shapes when playing with
a flashlight in a dark room?Â  Question 1.4 poses another "what happens?"
question.

##### ***Question 1.4 What happens when you place a barrier between a lamp and screen?*** {#chapter-003-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-2.html#U1H54}

Equipment: Find a *barrierÂ * of some kind to add to your set up. This
can be a card or a book that can stand up on its edge or even just
fingers on your hand.

-   Predict what you will see when you place the barrier between the
    lamp and screen as shown in Fig. 1.6.

FIG. 1.6 Predict what you will see when placing a barrier in front of
the screen.
:::
:::

-   Place a barrier between a lamp and a screen: What do you see on the
    screen?
-   Try a variety of ways of placing the barrier with respect to the
    lamp and screen. Making different shadows with a barrier can be a
    lot of fun! What do you observe?

Â 

Another kind of question asks "how" something is happening:

##### ***Question 1.5Â  How does light seem to travel from a source to a screen?*** {#chapter-003-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-2.html#U1H55}

A meter stick or yard stick is a useful tool to explore how light
travels from one place to another:

<div>

-   Use a straight stick such as a meter stick or yard stick to explore
    how light gets from the lamp past the barrier to the edge of a
    shadow on the screen.

</div>

-   Keep talking and refining ideas until your group and the other
    groups reach a consensus on several central ideas about light and
    shadows based on this exploration.

For example, here is what one student reported seeing:

*We had a white piece of paper against the wall with the bottom of the
paper touching the table. There was a light bulb set up to shine light
toward the paper. There was a wooden block set up in front of the white
paper and when the light bulb shined upon the block, the light was
obstructed and as a result a shadow of the block was produced on the
screen.*

*We placed one end of a meter stick on the side of the light bulb; then
we placed the meter stick against the edge of the wooden block and
finally placed the opposite end of the meter stick against the white
paper.*

*We observed that the edge of the shadow, the edge of the wooden block,
and the side of the light source all lined up in a straight line.*

Â This suggests thatÂ ***light can be envisioned as rays traveling in
straight lines****.*

Figure 1.7 shows an example of using a straight stick as a *physical
model* for how light can be envisioned as rays traveling in a straight
line from a light source past the edge of a barrier to the edge of a
shadow on a screen.

FIG. 1.7 A straight stick can provide a physical model for how light
travels.
:::
:::

Looking closely at a lamp and barrier setup suggests Question 1.6, a
"how many?" question:

##### **Question 1.6 *How many shadows are there when a light source shines*** ***on a barrier and screen*** **?** {#chapter-003-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-2.html#U1H56}

-   Look at both sides of the barrier as well as at the screen.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Keep talking and refining ideas until your group and the other
    groups reach a consensus about how many shadows there are when a
    light source shines on a barrier in front of a screen.

Here is what one student reported:

*The first shadow that I observed was one on the white piece of paper.
When an object was placed in front of a white piece of paper with a
light shining on it, the object's shadow was seen on the nearby piece of
paper. The second shadow that I observed was on the back side of the
object. The back side of the object...was dark and had a shadow on
itself.*

Physics Student, Spring 2016

This suggests another central idea about light and shadow phenomena as
shown in Fig 1.8: ***There are two kinds of shadows: An object blocks
light a) from shining on a nearby surface (ground, table, wall, screen)
and b) from shining on the back side of the object itself.***

A student supported this idea as follows:

*An argument based on evidence to support this idea is that a shadow was
seen on the piece of paper, which is the object blocking light from
hitting the nearby surface, and a shadow was seen on the back side of
the object which was the object blocking light from hitting the backside
of itself, which shows that there are two different kinds of shadows
created by an object.*

Question 1.7 introduces an open-ended question that invites you to
explore additional light and shadow phenomena by yourself, with a small
group of colleagues, and/or with friends and family members:

##### ***Question 1.7 What can you find out about light and shadows*** ***with a lamp, barrier, and screen?*** {#chapter-003-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-2.html#U1H57}

::: {.textbox style="text-align: center"}
Equipment: Play with lamp, barrier, and screen to find out what else you
can learn about light and shadows.
:::

-   Describe your explorations, evidence from your observations, central
    ideas about light and shadows that you infer from these
    explorations, the argument that supports those ideas and any
    relevant vocabulary.
-   Reflect upon what you have learned and what you are still wondering.
-   Write a summary of the central ideas based on evidence that emerged
    from the small group conversations and whole group discussion.

A useful way to organize outcomes from a series of explorations is to
summarize them in a table as in Table I.1.

  : TABLE I.1 Explorations of light phenomena

[\* Central idea(s) about light and shadows developed during exploration
with group members and/or friend/family]{style="font-size: 10pt"}

During class, some groups decide to explore what happens when they move
the barrier closer or farther from the light source. Others choose to
move the light source. Â A whole group discussion of their findings
suggests another central idea:

**Changing the position of the barrier with respect to the lamp and/or
the screen, changes the size, shape, and sharpness of the shadow on the
screen**.

This completes our initial exploration of the nature of light phenomena.
Based on the evidence from your observations, summarize the central
ideas that you have inferred about:

-   How does light leave most light sources?
-   How can light be envisioned as traveling from one place to another?
-   What kinds of shadows form when light shines on an object?
-   What influences the size, shape, and sharpness of a shadow on a
    screen?

These ideas form a conceptual model you can use to explain interesting
phenomena you observe during additional explorations.

After summarizing your explorations in class, enjoy some students'
reflections on teaching friends and children about light and shadows.

##### ***Question 1.8 What happens when exploring light and shadowsÂ *** ***with a friend or family member?*** {#chapter-003-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-2.html#U1H58}

#### *1. Examples of students' explorations of light and shadows with friends and/or family members.* {#chapter-003-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-2.html#U1H43}

A student reported:

*During this exploration my friend and I began by discussing the
previous Â ideas.Â  When talking about light and shadows, we began to talk
about how when we were younger we could use light to create shadow
puppets with our hands.Â  We decided to get out a lamp, turn the lights
off, and use the light to create shadows onto the ceiling.Â  During this
exploration we noticed how the closer our hands were to the light source
the shadow of our hand on the ceiling was bigger, and when we moved our
hands further from the light source our shadows would become smaller and
more defined. During this exploration I learned that as the one teaching
the concepts and ideas I can also be learning and exploring with my
students, the activities can be guided by both the student and the
teacher experiences.*

Physics Student, Spring 2016

Another observed the following when exploring shadows with a friend:

*When exploring shadows, my friend and I took a particular interest in
the effects of having more than one light source when facing the
barrier. Introducing a new light source from a new position in the room
changes both the area and the position of the shadow that the barrier is
making, depending on which way it is facing.*

Physics Student, Fall 2015

One student chose to explore all of the set of central ideas we had
developed in class with three children whom she babysat. This was more
than expected but a delightful example of a prospective elementary
school teacher gaining experience teaching what she had just learned
herself in class. She chose to use the initial version of the first
central idea with these young children. Her verbatim quotes provide an
excellent window into what preschool and elementary age children know,
think, and wonder about light:

*While working on this project I enlisted the help of three girls that I
babysit. The ages of these girls are as follows: Lucie-7, Ava-4, Ruby-4.
The names of these girls have been changed for the purpose of this
assignment and for other assignments in future. I had the girls explore
with light and used their own words and findings to help them understand
more about how and why light works.*

*-- **Light leaves a source in all directions.***

*For this idea the girls and I went to a room where I could close the
door and there were no windows. I then placed a lamp with no lamp shade
in the center of the room on a table and had each girl sit on her own
bed in the room. I turned off the room light and asked the girls what
they noticed about the light.*

*Lucie: "The light shines up and down, up towards the ceiling and down
towards the ground so we can see both."*

*Ava: "The light in the center is brighter than the top and bottom"*

*Me: "what do you mean by that Ava?"*

*Ava: "The light in the middle of the light bulb is brighter than it is
on the ceiling or the floor or the walls."*

*Me: So where is the light shining?*

*Ruby: "Everywhere."*

*Me: Everywhere?*

*A: Well everywhere in the room its shining.*

*Me: Where is the light shining from. Does it start at the walls and
move in, is it just here, does it have a place where it starts?"*

*Lucie: "The light is coming from the light on the lamp. And it shines
in all of the room"*

*So our evidence that the light leaves a source in all directions was as
follows:*

*-Light could be seen in all corners of the room.*

*-Light could be seen on the floor and ceiling of the room.*

*-The light came from the lamp (source) and then filled the room in all
areas.*

***-- Light can be envisioned as rays traveling in straight lines***

*For this idea the girls and I went outside the house to where a light
post was shining light onto a wall of the barn and onto the ground. We
then examined our shadows to see what we could find out about how light
works. The following are observations made by the girls that allowed us
to make connections to the idea that light can be envisioned as rays
traveling in straight lines. They will be serving as evidence for this
idea*

*-"When an object blocks the light it casts a shadow."*

*-"Even if we move or change our spots in the light, our shadows always
fall the same way. So the light is traveling in only that one way."*

*-"If we stand outside the light and look we can see the edges of where
the light shines because the light stand tunnels -focuses- the light
into one spot, like a flashlight.*

*-When one girl stood in the light I handed a long yard stick to the
other girls and asked them to make a series of lines from different
positions ie. make a line with the yard stick from Lucie's hand to the
same spot on Shadow Lucie's hand. The girls did so many times and
ultimately decided that since the shadows blocked light in a straight
line, that the light must be going in a straight line as well.*

***--For someone to see something, light has to travel to the person's
eyes.***

***Â Â Â Â Â Â Â *** *For the purpose of our project it is important to note
that I changed the order in which these experiments took place. I first
worked with the girls on the idea for someone to see something, light
has to travel to the person's eyes. We then explored light bounces off
of objects such as someone's nose in many different directions.*

*For this experiment I had the girls return to the room in which we
found out that light leaves a source in all directions. In this room I
changed the lights multiple times and asked the girls questions; while
doing so I had the girls also switch between covering and closing their
eyes and opening their eyes. The following are a list of what was
changed and what the girls' answers were.*

*-Lucie covers and closes her eyes, but Ava and Ruby do not. I ask "who
can see me? Raise your hand" Lucie is the only girl who does not raise
her hand. I ask her: "why couldn't you see me?" Lucie responds that she
couldn't see me because she "can't see with her eyes closed."*

*-Next, I had all three girls cover their eyes and asked if they could
see me, the lights were on at this time. All three girls reported they
could not see me.*

*-- I then turned off the lights and had all three girls open their eyes
and asked if they could see me. All three girls reported that no, they
could not see me. When asked why Ava responded " it's too dark to see
you."*

*-I then turned on the light and asked the girls if they could see me
with their eyes opened. All three girls said yes. When I asked them what
they thought their eyes needed to see they responded "Light!" When I
asked if they only needed to open their eyes to see they said "No,
because we opened our eyes with no lights on and couldn't see." So I
asked them again what was needed in order for eyes to see, the girls
told me you must open your eyes and also have the lights on which means
that our eyes need light to see.*

***-- Light bounces off of objects such as someone's nose in many
different directions.***

*Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Since the girls had already made the connection that light is
needed to see, and that it must travel to their eyes to see, this
project was fairly easy. I turned off the light in the room and shined a
flash light at one object at a time and asked questions as to what the
girls saw. I then turned on the light and asked more questions to the
girls. The following serves as our evidence for this idea.*

*-- When the light is shined on one object such as Lucie's teddy bear
the girls could all see it. When I asked why that was the girls said "
because our eyes can only see what the light sends back to us, we can
only see what is in the light, because our eyes need light to see."*

*-I then turned on the light and asked what the girls could see, they
said "everything." When I asked why that was they said it was "because
the lights are on." I asked if this meant the light was traveling to
their eyes like earlier and they said "Yes!"*

*-I then pointed to my nose and asked everyone who could see it to raise
their hand. All three girls raised their hand.*

*-I asked the girls how they could see my nose and they said because the
light was on it and coming back to their eyes. I asked how each girl
could see it from where they were standing. Can the light reach all of
those spots or does the light only bounce off of something in one
direction?\
*

*After some thought and deliberation as well as Lucie shining a
flashlight at my nose, the girls came to a conclusion. In order for all
of them to see my nose in different spots, my nose must be bouncing back
light to all of their eyes. This means that light bounces off of objects
in many different directions.*

*--**Two kinds of shadows***

***Â Â Â Â Â Â Â *** *For this part of the experiment I had the girls return
outside to the light post. I then asked a series of questions about
shadows, as well as where shadows could be seen. The following is what
was discovered and decided upon as evidence.*

*Me: What is a shadow?*

*Lucie: "A shadow is where something blocks the light from traveling any
farther and reflects the light only backwards."*

*Me: What does a shadow look like?*

*Ava: " Shadows are darker than the parts where the light shines
through. You can't see them as much."*

*-I then stood with my back to the light so my back would be lit up and
my front would be shadowed. In front of me a shadow was cast on the
ground. I asked the girls to come touch where they saw a shadow.Â  All
three touched the shadow on the ground.*

*-- I then asked the girls again what shadows look like and the same
answer was given. So I asked the girls to look for any other areas on me
or near me that looked like a shadow. After some deliberation and much
circling Ava exclaimed "Your face and Belly are dark, they don't have
light!" I asked if this counted as a shadow, Ava said "Yes." The other
two girls were unconvinced. So I asked Ava if she could explain what she
had found.*

*-Ava explained that "(her) back is blocking the light from reaching to
her front. A shadow is when something blocks the light and doesn't let
it go forwards. So (her) front is in shadow cause the light can't reach
there!"*

*-The girls then decided that in fact there were two kinds of shadows,
one on the ground and one on the back of the object casting the shadow.*

Physics Student, Fall, 2015

The students generate many ideas about light and shadows through such
conversations, often exploring well beyond what they might have
undertaken if simply given a set of directions in class. Also teaching
in a non-threatening environment with friends or family members can
enhance a prospective teacher's confidence. As one student reflected,
"*During this experience I learned that teaching science is not as scary
as I initially thought*."

So far we have developed two central ideas based on evidence about the
nature of light:

**Â Light leaves most sources in many directions.**

**Â Light can be envisioned as rays traveling in straight lines.**

These ideas form an *initial conceptual model of light*. These are ideas
that most people find easy to understand; they even are evident in the
art of young children, who typically draw a sun as a circle with
straight rays streaming out from the circle. Figure 1.10 is an example.

You can use these two central ideas to explain intriguing phenomena such
as what happens when light passes through a tiny pinhole.

### **A. Exploring pinhole phenomena** {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H35}

##### ***Question 1.9 What happens when light passes through a tiny pinhole and shines on a screen?*** {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H59 style="text-align: center"}

There are many ways to explore what happens when light passes through a
tiny pinhole. One way involves making a *pinhole camera* with materials
typically available at home. This is called aÂ camera but no photograph
is made as no film is used in this exploration.

Equipment for each student: Â a toilet paper or paper towel roll, square
piece of wax paper, square piece of aluminum foil, two rubber bands.
Equipment for each small group: a push pin. A meter stick (or yard
stick) and ruler also will be helpful in developing an explanation of
what one sees when looking through such a pinhole camera at a bright
light bulb in a dark room.Â \[In a remote learning situation, students
might have access to a paper cup or a cardboard box with a open end such
as Â a snack box whose bottom can be made light tight with duct tape.
Possible substitutions for the wax paper include a translucent cereal
box liner or plastic vegetable bag from a grocery store. A chocolate bar
liner might be a source of aluminum foil.\]

A student described making such a pinhole camera as follows:

*First I laid the wax paper over one opening of the toilet paper roll
and snuggly wrapped the edges down and secured the wax paper with a
rubber band. I then laid the aluminum foil on the other end of the
toilet paper roll and secured the edges of the aluminum foil with a
rubber band. I took a push pin and made a single hole in the middle of
the aluminum foil. I held the camera up so that the light from the light
bulb on the table could shine through the pinhole in the aluminum foil
and the wax paper faced me.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

-   Make a pinhole camera as described above.
-   When you look through a pinhole camera at a bright light bulb in a
    dark room, what do you think you will see on the wax paper screen?
    Record your prediction and your reasoning in the *Before* section of
    your physics notebook page.
-   After making a pinhole camera, darken the room and turn on a light
    bulb without a shade. Look at the light bulb through the pinhole
    camera. Hold the camera away from your face and point the aluminum
    foil end at the bulb as shown in Fig. 1.11. Move your hand around
    until you clearly see something on the wax paper screen. You may
    need to move closer or farther from the lamp.
-   Also move your head from side to side while holding the camera
    steady. Does this change what you see on the wax paper screen? If
    so, how?

### **B. Explaining pinhole phenomena** {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H36}

After observing *what is happening...* and *how something is happening*,
one likely will be asking a *why* question such as Question 1.10:

##### ***Question 1.10 Why are you seeing what you are seeing when looking*** ***at a bright light bulb through a pinhole camera in a dark room?*** {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H510 style="text-align: center"}

-   
-   Discuss with your group members some possible explanations for what
    you are seeing on the wax paper screen.
-   Sketching what is happening can help suggest and evaluate ideas. Get
    a large white board or piece of chart paper and work together to
    sketch the ideas you have generated.
-   Every so often step back and ask yourselves:\*
    -   What you are doing?
    -   Why are you doing that?
    -   How is that helping you?

(\*Alan Schoenfeld (1992) suggests this questioning sequence to help
people help themselves stay aware of whether what they are doing is
likely to be useful in solving a complex mathematics problem.)

-   Draw the light bulb and its *projection (*what you are seeing on the
    wax paper screen).
-   Omit drawing the camera itself; just draw the light bulb and its
    projection roughly parallel to each other and some distance apart.
-   How can you use your *conceptual model of light* (the two central
    ideas developed so far) to explain why you are seeing what you are
    seeing on the wax paper screen?

How, for example, are light rays leaving the light source?Â  Draw some
rays.

How are some of these rays traveling from the light bulb to its
projection on the screen?

-   How can you use your *physical model of light rays* (meter stick or
    yard stick) traveling from one place to another to think about how
    light is getting from the top of the light bulb to where the top of
    the projected bulb is on the wax paper screen?
-   Use your physical model of light rays to draw multiple rays
    traveling from various parts of the light source to where you are
    envisioning that they land on the screen to form the projection of
    the light bulb you are seeing.

In particular, draw rays leaving the top of the light bulb, the middle
of the light bulb, and the bottom of the light bulb and traveling
through the pinhole to form the projection of the bulb on the wax paper
screen.

-   Where is the pinhole located through which you are envisioning the
    light rays traveling from the source to the screen?

Represent the pinhole with an open circle and add the rest of the
pinhole camera to your sketch.

-   Do not erase the sketch that you have been drawing. This likely is
    quite messy. Admire it as a document representing some of your
    thought processes in developing this explanation of why you are
    seeing what you are seeing when light from a source passes through a
    pinhole to a screen.

Â 

-   A careful drawing with straight lines showing how one is envisioning
    light rays traveling from one place to another is called a *ray
    diagram.*

On a new large white board or piece of chart paper, draw a careful ray
diagram of this situation by using the meter stick to draw straight
lines representing how you are inferring light rays leave the light
bulb, travel through a tiny pinhole, and form a projection of the light
bulb on the wax paper screen.

-   On the back of your physics notebook page, draw a careful ray
    diagram by using a ruler to draw straight lines.
-   Write a clear explanation about what happens when light passes
    through a tiny pinhole and shines on a screen.

Complete your entries on your physics notebook page and write a summary
of this explanation before reading a student's example and about some
nuances about exploring, representing, and explaining pinhole phenomena.

#### *1. Student's example explanation of pinhole phenomena* {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H45}

*In (Question 1.3 and 1.5), we discussed how light goes everywhere and
that light rays travel in straight lines. With these ideas in mind, we
inferred that all of the light rays that travel through the pinhole are
traveling in straight lines. Because not all of these lines can travel
straight forward, some of the lines end up traveling diagonally. As a
result, the top of the light bulb gives off light rays that travel
diagonally straight so that they travel through the pinhole and this
diagonal line ends up projecting onto the bottom of the screen of the
wax paper as shown by the blue line in (Fig. 1.14).*

phenomena.
:::
:::

*The light rays from the center of the light bulb travel straight
forward through the pinhole and project the image of the center of the
light bulb on the screen of wax paper.*

*The orange line in Fig. (1.14) shows that the light rays given off of
the bottom of the light source travel in a straight line that is
diagonal and projects onto the top of the screen of wax paper.*

*There are many light rays given off of the light bulb between the top
and the bottom that all travel through the pinhole and project the image
of the light bulb to appear upside down on the screen of wax paper.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

The separate discussion of rays from the top, middle, and bottom of the
light source is helpful when explaining pinhole phenomena. Also helpful
is tracing each line with one's finger while discussing each ray if one
is talking about the ray diagram with someone just learning about these
phenomena.

#### *2. Some nuances in representing and explaining pinhole phenomena* {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H46}

Note that in the ray diagram in Fig. 1.14, the student has represented
the pinhole as an [*open circle*]{style="text-decoration: underline"},
where the lines representing the top, middle, and bottom light rays
cross in the diagram. A filled-in circle would not be appropriate in a
ray diagram representing pinhole phenomena because this would represent
a solid barrier through which light rays could not pass. The student
alsoÂ [used a ruler]{style="text-decoration: underline"} when
representing light rays traveling in straight lines and put
[arrows]{style="text-decoration: underline"} on the lines to indicate
the direction that the student was envisioning the light rays to be
traveling.

Also note that in Fig. 1.14 Â the student has drawn some short rays that
are leaving the top of bulb but are not heading toward the pinhole. This
represents a further refinement of the first central idea about how
light leaves a source.

Children's drawings of the Sun typically show rays leaving the Sun in
many directions as in Fig. 1.10. Â Each ray, however, seems to leave a
point on the source in only one direction, straight outward. Such
Â single raysÂ are arrayed around the circle representing the Sun.Â This
conception of how light leaves a source prompts an issue in explaining
pinhole phenomena: if rays only leave in a perpendicular direction from
a source, how can any rays from near the top of the bulb be traveling at
an angle, diagonally downward, toward the pinhole?

One way to address this issue is to cover the light bulb with aluminum
foil or a dark cloth so that light only shines out from a hole near the
top of the bulb. Does light shine from the hole only in one direction
perpendicular to the surface there? Or are the ceiling, floor, walls of
the room and people's faces still lit, at least dimly? If so, this
suggests an additional refinement to the first central idea:Â ***light
leaves [a point]{style="text-decoration: underline"} on most sources in
many directions.***Â This is an example of an aspect of the nature of
science articulated in the US *Next Generation Science
Standards*Â thatÂ *science is open to revision in light of new
evidenceÂ *(NGSS, Lead States, 2013, Appendix H,
<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices>Â ).

The student who drew Fig. 1.14 seems to be grappling with this issue in
the language used: *the top of the light bulb gives off light rays that
travel diagonally straight so that they travel through the
pinhole.Â *This student's language also illustrates a nuance that
sometimes confuses students: the meaning of the word *straight*. For
some people, *straight* only means *horizontal* rather than the more
general meaning of *without any bends*. This student invented the
phrases *straight forward* to mean *traveling horizontally without
bends,* as in the center gray rays, and *diagonally straight* to mean
*traveling at an angle without bends*, as in the top blue rays and the
bottom orange rays. Such elaboration is not required in this course;
simply discussing light as envisioned as rays traveling in straight
lines is sufficient.

It is important to realize that nothing happens within the pinhole. This
explanation envisions the light rays Â as simply passing through the
pinhole in a straight lineÂ on their way to where they are going, some
light rays from the top of the bulb traveling straight through the
pinhole to near the bottom of the screen, some light rays from the
middle of the bulb traveling straight through the pinhole to near the
middle of the screen, and some light rays from the bottom of the bulb
traveling straight through the pinhole to near the top of the screen.
The light rays are envisioned as simply passing through the pinhole on
their way to separate places on the screen.

Sometimes students use the word *flipped* to refer to the upside down
projection that they see on the screen. This word is not appropriate
here, however, because it suggests that something happened to the rays
to cause a flip but [nothing
]{style="text-decoration: underline"}happens to flip the rays that form
the projection. The rays forming the upside down projection are
envisioned as simply continuing to travel in straight lines from the
source through the pinhole toward the screen. One can see the upside
down bulb because the aluminum foil blocks other rays from traveling to
the screen.

A confusion also can occur over the use of the word *projection*. Does
the phrase *top of the projection* refer to what one sees near the top
of the screen (which is the projection of the bottom of the bulb) OR
does the phrase *top of the projection* refer to the projection of the
top of the bulb (which occurs near the bottom of the screen)? To avoid
confusion, it is important to use the cumbersome but clear phrase "where
these light rays form the projection of the
[top]{style="text-decoration: underline"}[of the
bulb]{style="text-decoration: underline"}[near the bottom of the
screen]{style="text-decoration: underline"}." The word *projection* is
preferred over the word *image* here as the word *image* in
physicsÂ typically refers to different light phenomena involving mirrors
and lenses.

Like adults, children typically are surprised and intrigued by seeing an
upside down light bulb when they look through a pinhole camera. As
indicated by their drawings of the sun, children already know the key
idea for understanding pinhole phenomena, that light can be envisioned
as rays traveling in straight lines.

When discussing pinhole phenomena, with both children and adults, it is
helpful to [use a finger to trace the
line]{style="text-decoration: underline"} on a ray diagram while
discussing how rays from a particular part of the source are traveling:

Some light rays from the top of the light bulb are traveling straight
through the pinhole to form the projection of the top of the light bulb
near the bottom of the screen,

Some light rays from the middle of the light bulb are traveling straight
through the pinhole to form the projection of the middle of the light
bulb near the middle of the screen,

Some light rays from the bottom of the light bulb are traveling straight
through the pinhole to form the projection of the bottom of the light
bulb near the top of the screen and

Some light rays from all up and down the light bulb are traveling
straight through the pinhole to form the rest of that upside down
projection of the light bulb on the screen.

### **C. Exploring a critical issue** {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H37}

Missing from the discussion so far is a critical issue, how is
information about what is happening getting to an observer?

##### ***Question 1.11 How does someone see this projection on the screen****?* {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H511 style="text-align: center"}

-   Look again at what you see when looking at a bright light bulb
    through a pinhole camera.
-   Hold the camera steady while moving your head from side to side.
    Does your view of the projection change? If so, how? What does this
    imply about how light travels through translucent materials such as
    the wax paper screen?
-   Also consider what has to happen for someone to see something: How
    did the light rays get from the projection on the wax paper screen
    to your eye?
-   Where on your ray diagram would you represent your eye looking at
    the projection on the screen?
-   How would you represent on the ray diagram what is happening when
    you see the projection on the screen?

Complete your entry on your physics notebook page and Table 1
(continued). Then write a summary of what you have learned before
reading example student work explaining how one sees pinhole phenomena.

#### *1. Example of student work about how one sees the projection on the screen* {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H47}

A student reported, "*I was still able to see the projection on the wax
paper when I would move my head from side to side*" and offered an
explanation "*We are able to see the image even when we move our head
because the light rays travel in many directions as they emerge from the
translucent wax paper so some of them still travel to our eyes*."

This student was invoking two additional central ideas developed in
class:

**Light rays emerge from translucent material (such as wax paper) in
many different directions.** Some of those directions are toward the
eye.

**For someone to see something, light has to get to the person's eye.**

The student added an eye to the ray diagram, with straight lines from
the projection to the eye to represent light leaving the projection and
traveling to her eye as shown in Fig. 1.15.

FIG. 1.15. Ray diagram for pinhole camera that includes light getting to
viewer's eye.
:::
:::

The student explained the complete ray diagram as follows:

*The orange line represents light rays traveling from the bottom of the
light bulb through the pinhole to the top of the screen and then some of
the rays travel in a straight line to the eyeball.*

*The middle grey line represents the light rays that travel from the
center of the light bulb through the pinhole, creating the image of the
middle of the bulb on the screen, then some travel to the eyeball.*

*The blue line represents the light rays that travel straight from the
top of the light bulb diagonally down through the pinhole and then
project the image of the top of the light bulb onto the bottom of the
screen of wax paper. Some of the blue rays then travel ...to the
eyeball.*

The notes added near the top and bottom on the right side of this
diagram illustrate the confusion of the meaning of the word *projection*
-- does this refer to what one is seeing? (bottom of the bulb near the
top of the screen) or to the entity itself ( the top of the projection
refers to what is at the top of the screen)? In this course, avoid the
phrases "bottom of projection" and "top of projection" and use instead
the clear phrase "where these light rays form the upside down projection
of the [top of the bulb near the bottom of the
screen]{style="text-decoration: underline"}."

### **D. Exploring variables affecting pinhole phenomena** {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H38}

Another type of question focuses upon identifying what is important to
notice in a situation:

##### ***Question 1.12 What variables affect what one is seeing on the screen?*** {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H512 style="text-align: center"}

-   Discuss with your group members ways you can change the pinhole
    camera you made and ways that you are using it.
-   Explore and report on some of these possibilities in Table I.2

  --------------------------------------------------------- -------------

-   In the "After" section of your physics notebook page, record two new
    central ideas, the evidence that supports these claims, and a
    rationale that explains how the evidence supports the ideas and why
    these are important.
-   Also write a reflection about what you have learned.
-   What are you still wondering?

Complete your entry on your physics notebook page and write a summary of
what you have learned before reading examples of student work of
exploring variables that affect pinhole phenomena

#### *1. Example of student work about variables that affect pinhole phenomena*. {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H48}

How big is the projection? How bright is it? How sharp is it? How many
projections does one see? Do distance from the light source, length of
the roll, size of the pinhole, shape of the light fixture, or number of
pinholes matter? As shown in Fig. 1.16, a student included the following
variables in reporting findings: distance from light, multiple pinholes,
size of camera roll, larger pinhole, and light fixtures of different
shapes:

This student then described these findings using "projected image"
rather than the more technically preferred "projection." Â The multiple
examples illustrate well, however, the many ways even young students can
enjoy exploring pinhole phenomena:

*When the distance between the camera and the light bulb increases, the
projected image of the light bulb on the wax paper screen becomes
smaller. When there are multiple pinholes in the aluminum foil, there
will be multiple projected images of light bulbs on the screen of wax
paper. When the length of the paper roll of the camera increases, the
projected image of the light bulb gets larger. When the pinhole is made
into a larger hole, the image becomes larger and fuzzier, it is more
difficult to tell if the image is still upside down or not.*

*When the camera is used to view light bulbs of different shapes, the
projected image of the light bulb on the wax paper screen will change
with the light fixture. For example, in class we looked at a light bulb
that was similar to a tear drop shape and our projected image looked
similar to an upside down teardrop. When I used the camera on a
spherical light fixture, the projected image looked like an upside down
circle. Some other questions that I have is: is this how our pupils
work? How did people discover the pinhole phenomena?*

Physics Student, Spring 2016

In this course, we are not exploring what happens within the eye, just
getting light to the eye. If you are wondering what happens next, after
the light enters the eye, consult a book or internet website about how
eyes work such asÂ <https://nei.nih.gov/kids/about_the_eye> .

The eye's pupil acts like a pinhole with a variable diameter that
controls how much light enters the eye. The projections on the retina
are upside down and are turned 'right side up' by your brain. Some
additional information about how the eye works is at:

#### *1. Examples of student explorations of pinhole phenomena with friends and/or family* {#chapter-004-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanation-for-intriguing-phenomena.html#U1H49}

A student explored pinhole phenomena with a cousin:

*I showed the pinhole phenomena with my 15 year old cousin. Before
seeing the projection he guessed that the projection on the wax paper
would be the shape of the pinhole. When he saw the projection his exact
words were "what the fudge?"*

*It took Z. a moment to realize what he saw was an upside down light
bulb. When asked why he thought the projection was upside down he said
"I have no idea.... I don't even know how it is projecting the stupid
light bulb!"*

*I then asked Z. what he knew about light; after some discussion he and
I came to the conclusion that light travels in all directions and that
light travels in straight lines called rays.*

*I asked Z. to draw on a whiteboard a representation of what he saw,
much like what I myself did in class with my group. Z. did so, and I
then asked him to use a ruler and his pen to draw rays leaving the light
bulb. At first Z. drew only light rays leaving in vertical and
horizontal lines. I then asked Z. to tell me again how light travels. Z.
said that it travels in all directions in straight lines. I asked him to
show me lines that traveled in all directions, so Z. drew more lines
leaving the bulb in all directions much like the lines above.*

*I then posed the question to Z. of how light was getting through the
tube and onto the screen. Something seemed to click with Z. then because
he erased his original drawing and drew a new bulb with about 10 rays
some of which went through the pinhole and onto the screen. He then told
me that since the rays that he drew at the top of the bulb "would
continue traveling on their downward path and would be projected onto
the bottom of the screen. The lights from the bottom of my bulb will
travel towards the top and be projected there. Is that right?"*

*I was honestly amazed at how quickly he picked up on the information. I
told him he was right and showed him my own ray diagram and he said that
it made sense. He then helped me find ways to alter the experiment,
which are shown in table 2.*

*From my experience working with and teaching Z. I realized how
frustrating it can be to work with older students. I do not mean for
this to sound bad, because in some ways it was refreshing to work with
an older student. Yet, as I worked with Z. I found that I am so
accustomed to working with younger children, these children need a
certain amount of guidance, more so than he did. Z. did need my help to
understand but much of what he was able to figure out on his own was
frustrating and interesting to me. His mind works so quickly and he
needed only a slight push in the right direction to understand. Knowing
this it was hard to hold my tongue and not explain everything to him
before allowing his mind to make the connections first.Â *

Physics student, Fall 2015

Another student chose to explore pinhole phenomena with a roommate:

*I explored pinhole cameras with one of my roommates. I began by asking
her what she knew about light (such as the direction it travels, whether
or not it travels in a straight line). To my surprise she already knew
that light traveled in all directions and in a straight line. I told her
to keep that in mind.*

*I then showed her the pinhole camera I had made in class and explained
what she would be doing with the light bulb and the camera. Before
turning on the light bulb I asked her what she thought would happen. She
said that she thought the light bulb would appear on the wax paper.*

*Â I then turned on the light bulb and asked her to look and tell me what
she saw. She was puzzled to find that the light bulb that appeared on
the wax paper was actually upside down. She could not tell me why this
happened.*

*I gave her a piece of paper and pencil and asked her to draw the entire
set up including what she had seen. I then asked her again to tell me
what she knew about light. When she said that light traveled in a
straight line I told her to stop and think about that.*

*She thought for a few seconds and then told me that light was entering
the pinhole camera in a straight line. I encouraged this by giving her a
ruler to add some straight light rays to her picture. After drawing
straight lines for a few seconds she connected the top of the light bulb
to the bottom of the light bulb on the camera with a straight line. She
did the same for the bottom of the light bulb. I asked her to tell me
what this meant. She explained that the ray coming from the top of the
light bulb travels in a straight line through the pin hole to the bottom
of the screen and the ray coming from the bottom of the light bulb does
the same, except it appears at the top of the screen.*

*I learned that being patient and providing my roommate with adequate
thinking time (private reasoning time), she was able to tell me exactly
what had happened. I prompted her throughout the experiment with
questions instead of telling her the answers. I also encouraged her to
build off of what she already knew (for example: that light travels in a
straight line).*

This concludes this example of using central ideas based on evidence to
explain intriguing phenomena.

Pinhole phenomena can provide useful tools in estimating quantities that
are otherwise hard to measure. To do so, we need to develop ways to
represent pinhole phenomena mathematically, both geometrically and
algebraically.

### **A. Representing pinhole phenomena geometrically** {#chapter-005-developing-mathematical-representations-of-pinhole-phenomena.html#U1H310}

The visual display provided by a ray diagram suggests describing pinhole
phenomena geometrically. First we simplify the diagram, next name and
label angles, and then interpret geometric aspects of two triangles
evident in the refined ray diagram.

##### ***Question 1.14* *How can you describe pinhole phenomena geometrically?*** {#chapter-005-developing-mathematical-representations-of-pinhole-phenomena.html#U1H514 style="text-align: center"}

The ray diagram in Fig. 1.14 includes realistic sketches of the light
bulb, the upside-down projection, and the pinhole camera as well as
lines representing light rays inferred to be leaving the source and
traveling straight through the pinhole to the screen.

This realistic portrayal of what we can actually see (the light bulb,
camera, and projection on the screen) was helpful in using our
conceptual model for light in explaining the upside-down projection of
the light bulb observed on the screen: We could infer that light was
leaving points on this source in many directions and envision that some
light rays were traveling in straight lines:

-   from the top of the light bulb straight through the pinhole to form
    the projection of the top of the light bulb near the bottom of the
    screen,
-   from the middle of the bulb traveling straight through the pinhole
    to form the projection of the middle of the light bulb near the
    middle of the screen, and
-   from the bottom of the bulb traveling straight through the pinhole
    to form the projection of the bottom of the light bulb near the top
    of the screen.

A more abstract stylized ray diagram, however, can focus attention on
the envisionedÂ light rays without the details of source, camera, and
screen as shown in Fig. 1.17:

-   Instead of a drawing of a light bulb, a vertical line represents the
    light source.
-   Instead of a drawing of an upside-down projection of the light bulb
    on the screen, a parallel shorter vertical line represents this
    projection.
-   Instead of an open circle, the pinhole is represented by an opening
    between short vertical lines above and below the point where the
    lines representing envisioned light rays cross. These short vertical
    lines represent the opaque end of the camera through which a pin was
    pushed to make the pinhole

FIG 1.17 Stylized ray diagram representing pinhole phenomena.
:::
:::

In Fig. 1.17, vertical black parallel lines represent the source and
projection rather than sketches of the bulb and upside down projection.
An opening between two small black vertical lines represents the open
pinhole. The blue straight lines represent rays of light inferred to be
traveling from the top and bottom of the bulb to the bottom and top of
the screen where they form the upside down projection of the light bulb.
The rest of the details of the source and the camera are not shown. The
description of what is happening is the same:

-   We are envisioning rays of light from the *top* of the vertical line
    representing the light bulb traveling straight through the opening
    representing the pinhole to form the projection of the top of the
    light bulb near the *bottom* of the screen.
-   We are envisioning rays of light from the *bottom* of the light bulb
    traveling straight through the opening representing the pinhole to
    form a projection of the bottom of the light bulb near the *top* of
    the screen.

By using straight parallel vertical lines to represent the source and
the projection, Fig. 1.17 simplifies the ray diagram so that two
triangles become evident.

-   What do these two triangles represent?
-   How are these two triangles related?

One way to describe a ray diagram geometrically is to begin by naming
the vertices of the triangles. In Fig. 1.18 for example, the vertices of
the triangle on the left are labeled A, B, C, whereas the vertices of
the triangle on the right are labeled F, E, C. (Later the letter D will
represent the distance between line AB and vertex C, so D is omitted in
naming vertices here.)

A student drew the ray diagram in Figure 1.19 at the close of a class
session in which the students developed and then used mathematical
representations of pinhole phenomena to estimate a quantity. This
student drew single, double, and triple lines to indicate clearly the
congruent corresponding angles of the two triangles formed in the ray
diagram:

Single lines indicate that angle c of the large triangle on the left
corresponds to and is congruent with angle c of the small triangle on
the right

Double lines indicate that angle a corresponds to and is congruent with

The student described this ray diagram geometrically:

*(The figure above) is a ray diagram consisting of two triangles that
share a point. I have labeled the vertices of each of the triangles a b
c, c e f, noticing that their shared vertex is c...We can conclude that
the two triangles are similar because of two different properties. The
first property, vertical angles property, states that angles acb and ecf
are congruent. Next, the alternate interior angles property allows us to
confirm that two different sets of angles are congruent: angles abc and
fec as well as angles bac and efc. The two triangles above, written acb
and ecf, are similar because each of their corresponding angles is
congruent. We know this because of the AAA, or Angle Angle Angle,
theorem. Because these triangles are similar, we can set up a
proportion...*

Physics student, Spring 2016

(This student also included some numerical information on this ray
diagram that refers to the activity involving pinhole cameras discussed
below under section VI.)

#### *2. Some nuances in representing pinhole phenomena geometrically * {#chapter-005-developing-mathematical-representations-of-pinhole-phenomena.html#U1H411}

In writing about the ray diagram shown in Fig. 1.19, the student invoked
several geometric ideas:

-   Angles formed by two intersecting lines are called *vertical angles*
    (as occurs at the pinhole C in Fig. 1.19) and are congruent, that
    is, they have the same measure; if one is 30 degrees, the other also
    is 30 degrees.
-   Some angles formed by a line (a *transversal)* intersecting two
    other lines are called *alternate interior angles* (such as angles a
    and f; also angles b and e in Fig. 1.19).

Alternate interior angles are congruent *onlyif* the two other lines are
*parallel*. If the two other lines are not parallel, the angles will
still be alternate interior angles but they will not have the same
measure, that is, they will not be congruent.

-   Two triangles are similar if all three corresponding angles are
    congruent:

Angle aÂ  is congruent with Angle fÂ  because they are alternate interior
angles formed by a transveral crossing two parallel lines.

Angle bÂ  is congruent with Angle eÂ  because they are alternate interior
angles formed by a transveral crossing two parallel lines.

Angle c of the big triangle is congruent with Angle c of the little
triangle because they are vertical angles

-   Corresponding lengths of similar triangles are proportional.

In naming the triangles "triangle acb" and "triangle ecf" this student
did not follow the convention to name similar triangles so that the
names of the corresponding angles are in the same position: the position
of Angle a in the name "triangle acb" would correspond to the position
of Angle f in name "triangle fce"; the position of Angle c in the name
"triangle acb" would correspond to the position of Angle c in the name
"triangle fce"; and the position of Angle b in the name "triangle acb"
would correspond to the position of Angle e in the name "triangle fce".

In referring to "angles abc and fec as well as angles bac and efc",
however, this student has followed the convention in that congruent
angles a and f are in the same position, congruent angles b and e are in
the same position, as are the angle c's.

Note that this student used lower case letters, rather than capital
letters, to identify angles on the ray diagram and then named each angle
by listing three lower case letters with the angle letter in the middle.
In this course, capital letters placed outside the vertex as in Fig.
1.18 are preferred in labeling angles of triangles such as Angle A and
in naming triangles, as in the statement "Triangle ABC is similar to
Triangle FEC".

The ray diagram in Fig. 1.19 clearly represents the congruent
corresponding angles in these two triangles. Note that the student has
used the space between two short vertical lines to represent the pinhole
as well as a ruler to make straight lines. The line with arrows drawn
from the projection to the viewer's eyes is ok in that light all the way
along the projections bounces off the screen to the viewer's eyes.
However, starting this line higher, at the vertex of Angle e, would
better represent rays *continuously* traveling from the bottom of the
source straight through the pinhole to form the projection of the bottom
of the light bulb near the top of the screen and then travel to the eye.

Note that the eye is shown to the left of the screen. This represents a
scenario in which the student was looking at a projection on a screen
where the light forming the projection reflected off an opaque screen
back to the eye as in Fig. 1.21 below rather than passing through a
translucent wax paper screen as in Fig. 1.15 above.

### **B. Representing pinhole phenomena algebraically** {#chapter-005-developing-mathematical-representations-of-pinhole-phenomena.html#U1H311}

The visual display provided by a ray diagram also suggests describing
pinhole phenomena algebraically. First, we name and label lengths as
well as angles, identify ratios of corresponding lengths that are equal,
and consider nuances in representing pinhole phenomena algebraically.

##### ***Question 1.15* *How can you represent pinhole phenomena algebraically?*** {#chapter-005-developing-mathematical-representations-of-pinhole-phenomena.html#U1H515 style="text-align: center"}

Representing pinhole phenomena algebraically requires naming aspects of
pinhole phenomena that you can measure and use in a calculation.
Identifying such quantities involves thinking about the *variables* in a
situation: what, for example, affects the size of the projection that
you see?

-   What can you do to make the projection bigger? Smaller?
    -   What happens to the projection if you move the camera closer to
        the source? Farther from the source?
    -   What happens to the projection if you make the camera longer?
        Shorter?
    -   What happens to the projection if you choose a higher light
        source? Lower?
-   Give names to those variables and draw a ray diagram that includes
    identifying those variables with symbols, in addition to labeling
    angles A, B, C, E and F.

Include, for example, a horizontal line from the middle of the vertical
line representing the light source, AB, to the middle of the vertical
line representing the projection to EF.

FIG. 1.20 Ray diagram representing pinhole phenomena.
:::
:::

Â 

Figure 1.20, for example, includes a line representing light rays
leaving the middle of the source, traveling straight through the
pinhole, to form the projection of the middle of the source on the
middle of the screen. This line also can represent two variables, the
length, *Distance D*, between the light source and the pinhole, and the
length, *distance d*, between the pinhole and the projection on the
screen.Â  The ray diagram in Fig. 1.20 also identifies *H* as *the
Height* of the source AB and *h* as *the height* of the projection EF.

Note that the symbols H, D, h and d represent *lengths* in the two
triangles whereas the symbols A, B, C, E, and F represent angles.

-   How are lengths related in similar triangles?

If two triangles are similar, their corresponding lengths are
proportional.

-   How would you express the relationship of corresponding lengths in
    similar triangles algebraically with symbols?
-   How would you express the algebraic relationship of corresponding
    lengths in similar triangles with words?

example of student work and some nuances in representing pinhole
phenomena algebraically.

#### *1. Example of student work representing pinhole phenomena algebraically* {#chapter-005-developing-mathematical-representations-of-pinhole-phenomena.html#U1H412}

A student summarized the mathematical relationship among the lengths of
similar triangles as follows:

*The property of similar triangles states that triangles can be
different sizes as long as they have the same shape. The same shape
depends on corresponding angles and proportionate sides.Â  In the figure
we can see the relevant vertices of the triangles and proportionate
sides where "H" is the height of the bulb and "d" is the distance from
foil to wax paper. The Height of the bulb over the Distance from the
bulb to the foil is equal to the height of the projection over the
distance from the pinhole foil to the wax paper.*

Â 

![\\begin{split} \\frac{H}{D} & = \\frac{h}{d} \\\\ \\frac
{\\text{Height of the bulb}}{\\text{Distance from the bulb to pinhole}}

pinhole to the projection}}

Physics student, Spring 2014

This student understood the basic property of similar triangles, that
they have the same shape but may be different sizes and that this means
that the ratios of corresponding lengths are equal.

#### 2. Nuances in representing pinhole phenomena algebraically {#chapter-005-developing-mathematical-representations-of-pinhole-phenomena.html#U1H413}

There are several aspects of representing pinhole phenomena
algebraically that need attention. These include choices made in using
language, naming variables, forming ratios, justifying the equal sign,
deciding on an appropriate algebraic representation to use, and using
one's sense-making skills to envision and monitor what one is doing.

Â 

*(a) Using language.* Part of learning physics is learning to use
language precisely. What words, for example, describe "H/D"?Â 
Colloquially this often is referred to as "H over D" or "height over
distance".Â  The use of the word "over" refers to how one expresses this
relationship in writing: one writes the H "over" the D. Such language
can be confusing for someone who does not infer the process represented
by the word 'over' and the line drawn between the H and D. A more
precise version would be to refer to "H divided by D" or "height divided
by distance".Â  This articulates the mathematical process involved,
division.Â  However, a more informative version would be to refer to "the
ratio formed by comparing H to D" or "the ratio formed by comparing the
height of something to some relevant distance, such as "the ratio formed
by comparing the height of the light source to its distance from the
pinhole."

Â 

*(b) Naming variables.* In developing an algebraic description of a
phenomenon, one has to give names and symbols to the variables that
matter, in this case how high the light bulb and its projection are, and
how far they each are from the pinhole. *Height* and *Distance* seem the
natural names for these variables with H and D used for the height of
the light source and its distance from the pinhole in the large triangle
and h and d used for the height of the projection and its distance from
the pinhole in the smaller triangle.

The horizontal line representing two distances here, however, would
typically be described as the heights of triangle ABC and triangle FEC.
Should one give a name to this variable that refers to what it is
representing, distance from the pinhole, or a name to this variable that
refers to its geometric role in the diagram, height of a triangle?

To avoid this confusion, sometimes we have used *length* to refer to the
vertical lines, but the lower-case l looks like a one and L/D = l/d is
also confusing. Note in Fig. 1.19, that this student had used the
letters W and w to represent the *width* of a circular light source and
its projection where use of a D and d might have been expected for
representing their *diameters,* but D and d were already in use for
representing *distances* from the pinhole.

The advantage of using the name *height* for the variables represented
by the vertical lines AB and EF is that this connects the mathematical
description to the objects the lines are representing, the light bulb
and its projection.

An essential aspect of developing a mathematical representation of a
phenomena is that after deciding on the names and symbols one wants to
use, be sure to state clearly what each variable and its symbol
represent.

Â 

*(c) Forming ratios*. When considering two similar triangles, it can be
helpful to form a ratio with variables in one triangle and set this
equal to a ratio formed with the corresponding variables in the other
triangle. The equation with ratios that this student stated, for
example, H/D = h/d, compares two lengths of the large triangle,
representing the height of the light source and its distance from the
pinhole, and sets this equal to a comparison of the two corresponding
lengths of the small triangle, representing the height of the projection
and its distance from the pinhole.

It is important to be able to express the equality of such ratios with
words as well as symbols: With H/D = h/d, one is equating "how the
height of the light source compares to the light source's distance from
the pinhole" with "how the height of the projection compares to the
projection's distance from the pinhole."

One also has the choice of in what order to make such a comparison. With
D/H = d/h, for example, one is equating "how the light source's distance
from the pinhole compares to the light source's height" with "how the
projection's distance from the pinhole compares to the projection's
height."

In both cases, this approach has the advantage that the units used
within the same triangle will match. In this case of comparing one
length to another length, with both lengths measured in the same units,
the ratios will be dimensionless. This means that, if convenient, one
can use units for the lengths in the large triangle that differ from the
units for the lengths in the small triangle.

Sometimes, however, one might want to compare the same variable in the
two triangles, setting the ratio of the heights, for example, equal to
the ratio of the distances: H/h = D/dÂ  In this case, one is setting
equal "how the light source's height compares to the projection's
height" with "how the light source's distance from the pinhole compares
to the projection's distance from the pinhole."Â  One also could set this
equation up as:Â  h/HÂ  =Â  d/D.Â  Here one is setting equal "how the
projection's height compares to the light source's height" with "how the
distance of the projection from the pinhole compares to the distance of
the light source from the pinhole."

Although cumbersome, keeping in mind the word description of what these
ratios represent can prevent randomly setting up an equation that may
look appropriate: h/D = H/d but is not justified in this context.

Â 

*(d) Justifying the equal sign*. When setting one algebraic expression
equal to another in this course, it is important to [justify the equal
sign explicitly]{style="text-decoration: underline"}.Â  For example, one
student wrote:

*In the figure, there are two triangles seen, triangle ABC and triangle
FCE. The two triangles are similar because they have three sets of
congruent angles.* *The first set of congruent angles are vertical
angles, in which Angle ACB â Angle FCE.* *The second set of congruent
angles are alternate interior angles, in which Angle CAB â Angle CFE.\
* *The third set of congruent angles are alternate interior angles, in
whichÂ AngleÂ CBA â Angle CEF.*

*Since the two triangles have congruent angles, they are therefore
similar triangles because of the AAA theorem. The corresponding sides of
similar triangles are proportional, which is why we are able to set up a
proportion comparing the two triangles.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

Note that this student has not used the convention in naming the
triangles.Â  Triangle ABC puts angle C in the third position but Triangle
FCE puts angle C in the second position. An alternative would be
Triangle ABC is similar to Triangle FEC or Triangle ACB is similar to
Triangle FCE. The student has used the conventions in naming angles so
that the angle of interest is the middle letter: AngleÂ ACB and AngleÂ FCE
are both referring to the angle where the two lines cross at C.
AngleÂ CAB refers to the angle at A and AngleÂ CFE refers to the angle at
F, a set of alternate interior angles at A and F. Â AngleÂ CBA refers to
the angle at B and AngleÂ CEF refers to the angle at E, the other set of
alternate interior angles.

Â 

*(e)Choosing an appropriate algebraic representation*. If H/D = h/d,Â 
D/H = d/h,Â  H/h = D/dÂ  and h/H = d/D, which set of equal ratios should
one use?

If you can measure three of the variables and need to calculate the
forth, any of these will work.Â  However, some are easier to use than
others.

Solving for an unknown that is in the numerator for many students is
easier than solving for an unknown in the denominator. If asked to find
the height of a projection, h, for example, choose a version with h in
the numerator: H/D = h/dÂ  orÂ  h/H = d/D .Â  Then isolate h by multiplying
both sides by the variable in the denominator:

Â ![h =
d\\,(\\frac{H}{D})](OEBPS/assets/79db0e813ef81fd955f7b30e182fde42.png "h = d\,(\frac{H}{D})"){.latex
.mathjax}Â  orÂ  ![h =
H\\,(\\frac{d}{D})](OEBPS/assets/7373496d51a4030161021db28a61d667.png "h = H\,(\frac{d}{D})"){.latex
.mathjax}

Note: Avoid using x to represent multiplication in an algebraic equation
as this can be misinterpreted as representing an unknown.Â  Use
parentheses or a dot:

![h = H \\,\\bullet\\,
\\frac{d}{D}](OEBPS/assets/957ab8bb5e1d02e0c846001bd62854c0.png "h = H \,\bullet\, \frac{d}{D}"){.latex
.mathjax} to represent multiplication.

Â 

*f) Using sense-making skills to envision what an equation is doing.*
People in this course typically differ in their experiences and comfort
in setting up and solving algebraic equations. If you are feeling some
anxiety after reading this section, it is important to give yourself
time to connect each symbol with what it means, not only by writing out
its definition and labeling it on your ray diagram but also by
visualizing what the symbol represents within an equation.

When solving a pinhole problem, for example, write h = height of the
projection and place an h next to the vertical line representing the
projection on your ray diagram; then step back and visualize the size of
the upside down projection you saw on the wax paper screen of the
pinhole camera. Do the same for the d, H, and D.

The goal is to become familiar enough with the symbols that when you see
H/D = h/d, your mind visualizes what those ratios mean:

-   you can "see a comparison in your head of the big Height of the
    light bulb with the big Distance from the light bulb to the pinhole
    of your pinhole camera;
-   you can "see" a comparison in your head of the little height of the
    projection with the little distance from the pinhole to the wax
    paper screen of the pinhole camera;
-   and you can "see" that those comparisons seem about equal;
-   that, for example, the big Height of the light bulb is about a tenth
    of the size of the big Distance from the light bulb to the pinhole
    in the pinhole camera in your hand
-   and that the little height of the upside down light bulb projection
    seems about a tenth of the size of the little distance from the
    pinhole in the aluminum foil end of the tube to the wax paper
    screen.

Also use words to tell yourself a story about what the equation is
doing, that the equation is comparing heights to distances in two
similar triangles and if the triangles are similar, the comparisons of
heights to distances are equal even when the sizes of the triangles are
very different. Visualizing what the equation is doing is key to
clarifying in your mind whether you have set up the equation in a way
that makes sense.

Â 

*(g) Using sense-making skills to monitor what one is doing.* In
addition to visualizing what an equation is doing, it is important to
use sense-making skills to monitor what you and your group members are
doing. In solving a complex problem, it is easy to get focused on some
detail that in the end is not needed. To make productive progress, it is
important to step back for a moment to ponder:

-   What are we doing?
-   Why are we doing that?
-   How will that help us?\*

This is particularly important to do periodically when engaged in a
multi-step endeavor, such as designing an experiment, collecting data,
and using the data and one's knowledge of physical phenomena to estimate
a quantity that can not be directly measured such as the diameter of the
Sun.

asÂ meta-cognitive checks when engaged in problem-solving.

Pinhole phenomena can provide a way to estimate a quantity that one can
not directly measure.

### **A. Using pinhole phenomena to estimate the diameter of the Sun** {#chapter-006-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-an-interesting-quantity.html#U1H312}

##### ***Question 1.16 How can you use pinhole phenomena to estimate the diameter of the Sun?*** {#chapter-006-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-an-interesting-quantity.html#U1H516 style="text-align: center"}

How big do you think the Sun is?Â  It would not be possible to travel to
the Sun and measure its diameter directly. Using pinhole phenomena,
however, provides a way to estimate this quantity from Earth.

-   In the *Before* section of a notebook page, record your initial
    estimate of the size of the Sun.

It looks about the same size as the Moon in the sky. Both seem small
compared to the size of the Earth from which we are viewing them.
However both are far away and things far away look smaller than they
are.Â  How big do you think the Sun's diameter might be?

-   How could you use pinhole phenomena here on Earth to estimate the
    Sun's diameter?
-   A good way to start designing an exploration is to draw something
    that will help you think about what to do. For example, draw a ray
    diagram representing pinhole phenomena.
    -   Which line on your ray diagram could represent the diameter of
        the Sun?
    -   Which line could represent a projection of the Sun here on
        Earth?

Equipment: One way to estimate the diameter of the sun involves using a
meter stick, some aluminum foil, a piece of cardboard to support the
aluminum foil, scissors to cut a hole in the center of the cardboard,
tape to tape the aluminum foil in place,Â a pin to make a pinhole in the
foil, a white paper screen, a piece of cardboard to which to tape the
white paper screen to keep it firm, a pencil to trace the Sun's
projection on the white paper screen, and a sunny day.

\[In a remote learning situation, students may not have access to a
meter stick or yard stick but they likely have a ruler and shoestrings.
After tying the shoestrings together to make a long string, use the
ruler to measure where to tie a knot on the long string to measure 100
centimeters (or 3 feet if the ruler only has inches marked). Keep the
string taunt when establishing the distance between the pinhole and the
screen.\]

#### *1. Example of student work in estimating the diameter of the Sun* {#chapter-006-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-an-interesting-quantity.html#U1H414}

A student described the exploration process as follows:

Â 

*First create a camera using foil, a piece of paper, cardboard, a push
pin, a meter stick, and a sunny day. First cut a square out of the
middle of the cardboard and cover that opening with the foil. Poke a
hole in the middle of the foil with a push pin.*

*To carry out the experiment, hold the screen up so that it faces the
sun. Another person will hold the foil and cardboard between the sun and
the screen and direct the sun rays that are traveling through the
pinhole to project the upside-down image of the sun onto the screen. A
third person will hold a meter stick with one end touching the screen
and one end touching the cardboard with foil. A fourth person will trace
the projected upside-down image of the sun that is on the paper.*

FIG. 1.22. Sketch of estimating the sun's diameter with pinhole
phenomena.
:::
:::

Physics student, Spring 2016

The student sketched this exploration process as shown in Fig. 1.22. In
this class, we referred to the diameter of the sun as its *Width*,
represented by the symbol capital W, in order to avoid confusion with
the symbol D representing the distance from the sun to the pinhole. We
referred to the diameter of the Sun's projection as its *width*,
represented by the lower-case symbol w in order to avoid confusion with
the symbol d representing the distance of the screen from the pinhole.
Note that in this activity the Sun's rays should be shown as bouncing
off the opaque screen rather than shining through as in the previous
pinhole activity shown in Fig. 1.15.

This student described her group's interpretative process as follows:

*The group will measure the diameter of the traced projection onto the
screen. This was estimated to be about one centimeter (1 cm). This will
be variable w which represents the width of the projection.*

*We know that the distance from the pinhole to the projection is
one-meter-long (1 m) since we used a meter stick to separate the two. We
will convert the one meter (1 m) to one hundred centimeters (100cm) so
that the units are overall easier to work with. We will label this
distance as variable d.*

*We are given the distance from the sun to the earth and our camera,
which is about one-hundred million miles (100,000,000 mi) and will label
this as variable D.*

*We want to find out the width of the sun so we will label this as
variable W.*

*Since we know that this experiment creates triangles that are similar,
we can set up a proportion using our known and unknown variables to
determine the width of the sun.*

Physics Student, Spring 2016

This student drew a ray diagram and wrote the relevant mathematics as
shown in Fig. 1.23.

Figure 1.23. Student ray diagram and relevant mathematics for estimating
the diameter of the Sun.
:::
:::

The student labeled the diagram well:

-   the long vertical line on the left as representing the Sun, with the
    symbol W defined as the width of the Sun, and ? to indicate that
    this was the unknown
-   the horizontal line from the "Sun" to the pinhole as the distance D,
    equal to about 100,000,000 miles
-   the dotted line representing the foil with a pinhole in the middle
    as the pinhole
-   the short horizontal line from the pinhole to the projection as d,
    equal to 1 meter or 100 centimeters
-   the short vertical line on the right as representing the projection
    of upside down image of the Sun, with the symbol lower case w, equal
    to 1 centimeter.

Fig. 1.23 clearly shows the representation of pinhole phenomena by this
student in estimating the diameter of the Sun. There are, however,
several minor issues to consider in this otherwise excellent ray
diagram. An open circle, rather than a solid line, would better
represent the pinhole through which light rays are envisioned moving. A
solid rather than dotted line would better represent a solid surface
that blocks other rays from traveling through the pinhole.Â  The rays
from the Sun bounced off the opaque screen back to the eyes as shown in
Fig. 1.19 rather than continuing through a translucent wax paper screen
as in Fig. 1.14.

This student wrote out the relevant ratios in words first before
representing them with symbols:

![\\begin{split} \\frac{\\text{Width of the sun}}{\\text{Distance from
Sun to pinhole}} & = \\frac{\\text{width of projection}}{\\text{distance
from pinhole to projection}}\\\\\\frac{W}{D}& =
\\frac{w}{d}\\\\W&=(\\frac{w}{d})D
\\end{split}](OEBPS/assets/0c55ee949b108413943ea6ea3f010c43.png "\begin{split} \frac{\text{Width of the sun}}{\text{Distance from Sun to pinhole}} & = \frac{\text{width of projection}}{\text{distance from pinhole to projection}}\\\frac{W}{D}& = \frac{w}{d}\\W&=(\frac{w}{d})D \end{split}"){.latex
.mathjax}

Writing out an equation in words as well as in symbols is important to
do when teaching in order to be sure that students are following the
reasoning.

The justification for the equal sign was that the triangle formed by the
rays from the Sun and the pinhole is similar to the triangle formed by
the pinhole and rays from the Sun inside the camera, and that the ratios
of corresponding lengths of similar triangles are equal.

The student solved for the unknown, W = (w/d) (D),

substituted numerical values, ![W = \\frac{1 \\, cm}{100 \\,
cm}(100,000,000 \\,
miles)](OEBPS/assets/25c99fc1fd1536c36d1afcc9c7d07153.png "W = \frac{1 \, cm}{100 \, cm}(100,000,000 \, miles)"){.latex
.mathjax}

and calculated the estimate for the sun's diameter, 1,000,000 miles.

In this case, the students did not need to convert miles to centimeters
because the ratio w/d was dimensionless, 1 cm/100 cm = 1/100.

The distance of the sun to the pinhole was given as 100,000,000 miles
(rather than about 93,000,000 miles) so that calculating the estimate
would be easy and the attention would be on the magnitude of this
estimate rather than on details involving a more accurate value for the
distance to the sun. What is one hundredth of a hundred million miles?Â 
One million miles! If you can envision what the equation is
representing, one can calculate this estimate in one's head!

The student also reported the status of the variables, as shown in Fig.
1.24 below.

FIG. 1.24 Student's report of the status of variables in estimate of the
diameter of the Sun.
:::
:::

In designing and carrying out a mathematical estimation, it is useful to
consider what each symbol represents. The value represented by the
symbol d, for example, the distance of the projection from the pinhole,
was *chosen* as part of the design of the exploration by the
availability of a convenient tool, a meter stick of length 100
centimeters.

The diameter of the projection, w, 1 centimeter, was *measured* during
the exploration. Some students' tracing of the projection had a diameter
of 0.9 cm; others 1.1 cm; many 1.0 cm. Using 1.0 cm seems a reasonable
value given the variation in ways small groups held the pinhole and
screen a meter stick length apart.

The distance D of the Sun from the Earth was *an approximate value
provided by the instructor* based on an accepted value of about 93
million miles. This approximation made calculating the estimate easy so
the students' focus would be on the phenomena and not on detailed
calculations.

The diameter of the Sun, W, was the *unknown*, estimated by calculating
its value in the equation based upon the mathematics describing pinhole
phenomena.

Is a diameter of one million miles a sensible result for an estimate of
the diameter of the Sun?

What sense-making strategies can you use to consider the reasonableness
of this result?

#### *2. Some nuances in using mathematical representations of pinhole phenomena* {#chapter-006-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-an-interesting-quantity.html#U1H415}

Students often use an equal sign to represent "the next step is" to
solve for the unknown variable. That is best represented by an empty
space between two equations as the ratio w/d does not equal W.

After writing the equal ratios in words and the equivalent mathematical
statement in symbols, this student appropriately solved for the unknown,
W, with W = (w/d) (D) before substituting numerical values. This is a
process that is very important to do. Substituting numerical values
before solving for the unknown often leads to calculation errors.

By solving an equation for the unknown before substituting numerical
values, one can readily check whether the dimensions of both sides
match:

If (W in length units) = (w in length units/d in length units) (D in
length units), the w/d will be dimensionless and the result will be
length units on the left and length units on the right.

By solving an equation for the unknown before substituting numerical
values, one also can consider whether the mathematics processes
indicated are conceptually appropriate:

W = (w/d) D indicates that first one is finding a ratio of two
quantities (w/d) and using that to find out how much of the distance D
in the other triangle, the other width W would be.Â  If the little width
w is half the length of the little distance d for one triangle, for
example, then the big width W would be one half of the big distance D.
Such visualizing of what the equation is doing is a useful way to check
whether the equation one has derived makes sense.

This form of the equation, W = (w/d) (D), also makes clear that the
ratio w/d is dimensionless (w/d = 1 centimeter/100 centimeters = 1/100)
so there is no need to convert between centimeters and miles when
substituting values. This is an example of a detail that can consume a
lot of time, if one just does what one thinks one is supposed to do,
converting centimeters to miles, without monitoring whether it makes
sense to do so. It was necessary to convert 1 meter to 100 centimeters
to use centimeters for both quantities in the ratio of w/d in order to
obtain the dimensionless ratio of 1/100 but it was not necessary to
convert centimeters to miles.

We used the approximate value of 100,000,000 miles for the distance
between the Earth and the Sun (the distance D of the source from the
pinhole). This made the calculation easy, as 1/100 of 100 million miles
is 1 million miles.Â  Although the Sun looks small in the sky, its
diameter is very large!

A "not to scale" note would be helpful, given that rays of light from
the Sun are coming from so far away that they are nearly parallel as
they reach the earth rather than coming in at such a large angle. Such a
"not drawn to scale" also would be appropriate given that the 1 cm
projection is shown as larger than the 100 centimeter distance to the
pinhole. A more realistic ray diagram for this situation would be
similar to Fig. 1.25:

You can use your knowledge of pinhole phenomena to generate and solve
pinhole math problems. To make up such a problem, decide on a scenario
and specify three of the four variables involved: height of the object,
H; its distance to the pinhole, D; height of its projection on the
screen, h; and its distance to the pinhole, d.

In this course, the goal in solving a pinhole math problem is not the
"answer." The goal is to build your ability to help Â someone else
understand what to do and why. Start by helping the learner to
understand what is happening by describing the scenario verbally with
words and visually with a sketch. Next review the physics involved by
stating whatÂ the relevant central ideas are. Also draw a careful ray
diagram and use it and the central ideas to explain why the projection
is upside down. Then describe the ray diagram mathematically, being
clear about what each symbol represents, why the two triangles are
similar, and how the lengths of similar triangles are related. Finally
write the equation in both words and symbols, solve for the unknown in
symbols, substitute values and calculate the answer. Be sure to also
discuss why that answer seems reasonable. In facilitating a conversation
with someone about pinhole phenomena, ask questions rather than tell
answers throughout this process. In responding to homework problems in
this course, however,Â follow the format provided here:

#### *3. Using pinhole phenomena to estimate the Sun's diameter with friends and/or family members* {#chapter-006-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-an-interesting-quantity.html#U1H416}

##### ***Question 1.17 What happens when estimating the diameter of the*** ***Sun with friends or family members?*** {#chapter-006-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-an-interesting-quantity.html#U1H517}

A student reflected upon engaging her sister and mother in estimating
the diameter of the Sun as follows:

*To explore pinhole phenomena, I involved my younger sister to perform
the same experiment we did in class. I first explained what we did and
she stated that she has never heard of it before. Because she said she
has never heard of pinhole phenomena, I was excited to show her. I used
the same materials and made my own pinhole on a sheet of tinfoil. My mom
also helped by holding the meter stick. My mom also said she has never
heard of it. My mom is a third-grade teacher so she was excited to try
it out.*

*During the experiment, I asked them how big they thought the projection
on the white sheet was. Like I did, they thought it looked like about
one centimeter wide in diameter. My sister asked, "How can someone use
such a small reflection of the sun to help find the diameter of the
actual sun since the sun is so large and this is so small?" Because my
mom and sister don't have as much of a math background as I do, I was
very careful about what questions I asked.*

*I started out by giving them a hint and asked, "Have you heard of
similar triangles and corresponding angles?" I could tell my mom was a
little lost because math isn't her strong suit. Much like my sister, she
is a lot better at literature. My sister said yes! I told them the
distance from the sun is 100,000,000 miles, so by using the three
dimensions, I asked, "How can we use equal fractions to find the missing
dimension (diameter of sun)?"*

*My sister yelled, "Ratios!" My mom seemed a little lost so I then drew
similar triangles a lot like we did in class and labeled each dimension
we knew. I explained how the sides and angles were proportionate, which
is how we could create equal ratios. I asked them if our units needed to
be the same and my sister said yes. As a group, we found the same
results as we did in class.*

*My sister took calculus in high school and my mom doesn't know much
about math. Having those two different types of "students" that were at
either end of the spectrum, gave me the opportunity to practice for when
I am trying to explain to two students where one is at a higher level
than the other. I wanted my sister to explain the concept to my mom
because I know that some students learn better when they explain things
to other students.*

*Through this experience, I learned that when you have two students
where one understands the concept faster than the other, it's important
to let both students talk but also let the one student who understands,
explain what they know to the other student. This helps them learn from
each other.*

*I also learned to make sure I give time for the student that doesn't
understand to ask any questions they have and not let the other student
do all the work. I know it's important to make sure you leave a lesson
knowing that both students understand the process.*

*The last thing I learned was how to ask questions to give a hint when
the student is completely lost without giving them the answer. I
understand how frustrating it is when the teacher asked questions you
have no idea what the answer is. It's sometimes better to give them a
nudge when they are completely lost in the beginning and let them do the
rest of the work once they understand how they are going to find the
outcome.*

Physics student, Fall 2016

#### *4. Some thoughts about the nature of science in this context:* {#chapter-006-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-an-interesting-quantity.html#U1H417}

This completes an example of the process outlined for each unit:

Students first identify resources by reflecting upon what they already
know about a topic, such as the nature of light.

Next, they develop some central ideas based on evidence, such as light
leaves a point on most sources in many directions and light can be
envisioned as rays traveling in straight lines.

They can use those ideas to explain an interesting phenomenon, such as
why the projection of a light bulb seen through a pinhole camera is
upside down.

Then they develop mathematical representations of the phenomenon, such
as an equation stating that the ratio of the height of the light source
to the distance of the source from the pinhole is equal to the ratio of
the height of the projection to the distance of the projection from the
pinhole.

Finally, they use those mathematical representations to estimate an
interesting quantity, such as the diameter of the Sun. It is not
possible for anyone to travel to the Sun and use a measuring device to
directly measure its diameter. An estimate is feasible, however, using
simple equipment, some additional information from a reliable source,
and the scientific process developed here.

This process illustrates the strength of scientific ways of knowing. One
may be able to estimate a quantity of interest through a similar process
of identifying resources, developing central ideas based on evidence,
using these ideas to explain a puzzling phenomenon, figuring out ways to
represent the phenomenon mathematically, and using those mathematical
tools to estimate the quantity one wants to know.

[Several students recognized that this estimation process might be
useful in other contexts such as answering the question: 'how big is the
Moon"?Â  Note that making the decision to go there, or not, or to fund
creating a settlement on the Moon, or not, is a question of a different
kind, one that involves cultural issues and societal values as well as
the technical and scientific knowledge needed.]{style="font-size: 1em"}

[Many students also experienced some of the human aspects of science in
their surprise that the projection was upside down, frustration in
making sense of the mathematics, and perhaps pleasure in persisting
through to understanding what seemed for many to be an initially
confusing experience.]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"}

The process involvedÂ [in estimating theÂ diameterÂ of the Sun assumes
thatÂ the ratio of small distances here on Earth can be compared to the
ratio of very large distances in the solar system. This is an example of
an aspect of the nature of science articulated
inÂ ]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"}the USÂ *Next Generation
Science Standards* that*Â scientific knowledge assumes an order and
consistency in natural systems.* Third to fifth grade students, for
example, should understand that *basic laws of nature are the same
everywhere in the universeÂ *(NGSS, Lead States, 2013, Â Appendix H)
<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices>).

prism, you are experiencing a variety of light phenomena. In this
section, you will develop additional central ideas about reflection,
refraction, and dispersion. Then you will use these central ideas to

refers to one aspect of what happens when light shines on smooth or
rough surfaces.

rulers or pencils, a dark room and at least three people with whom to
collaborate. Clean the surface of the mirror so that the light reflects
from the mirror rather than from dust on the surface.\[In a remote
learning situation, a student working alone with a clear mirror and two
rulers, can place the mirror on a table next to a wall, lean one end of
a ruler against the wall, place the other end of that ruler on or next
to the mirror, place one end of the other ruler next to the first ruler
on or next to the mirror, and hold the flashlight so that it is shining
on the mirror at the same angle as the ruler. Move that ruler (and
flashlight) at different angles to see how the reflection of the light
moves up and down on the wall. Note the angle of the ruler when the
reflection on the wall is on the top of the first ruler.\]

FIG. 1.26 Who can see the light from the flashlight in the mirror?
:::
:::

-   When Person 2's face is lit, who can see light from the flashlight
    shining on the mirror?

Person 1 with the flashlight?\
Person 2 at the other end of the table?\
Person 3 at one side of the table\
Person 4 at the other side of the table?

-   If Person 2 goes up on tiptoes or crouches down low, what does
    Person 1 need to do to keep the light reflecting off the mirror onto
    Person 2's face?

-   Can you see light rays traveling from the flashlight to the mirror?\
    Can you see light rays traveling from the mirror to Person 2's face?

```{=html}

```
-   To envision light rays traveling from the flashlight to the mirror
    and from the mirror to Person 2's face, use a physical model for
    light rays:
    -   Hold one meter stick so that it models light rays traveling from
        the flashlight down to the mirror.
    -   Hold the other meter stick so that it models light rays
        traveling from the mirror up to Person 2's face.
    -   Make sure the two meter sticks are meeting on the mirror at the
        spot where Person 2 sees the beam of light reflected in the
        mirror.
-   The meter sticks make angles with the flat mirror. How do these
    angles compare?
-   [Make a sketch showing one meter stick modeling light rays traveling
    from flashlight to mirror and the other meter stick modeling light
    rays traveling from the mirror to Person 2's
    face.]{style="color: #999999"}
-   [Focus first on the meter stick modeling light rays traveling from
    the flashlight to the mirror. The meter stick and the mirror on the
    table are modeling the angle that one can envisionÂ *incident light
    rays* making with the mirror. Â This angle is called the *angle of
    incidence*.]{style="color: #999999"}

[About how big is this angle of incidence? (about 15Â°? 30Â°? 45Â°? 60Â°?
75Â°? )]{style="color: #999999"}

-   [Now look at the meter stick modeling light rays traveling from the
    mirror to Person 2's face. This meter stick and mirror on the table

    reflection.* ]{style="color: #999999"}

[About how big is this angle of reflection? (about 15Â°? 30Â°? 45Â°? 60Â°?

-   Draw a ray diagram that represents what you infer is happening when
    light from the flashlight reflects off the mirror into Person 2's
    face.
-   Label the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection. How are
    these angles related?

##### ***Question 1.19 What happens when light shines upon a rough surface?*** {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H519}

-   Now shine the flashlight on the table rather than on the mirror.

Who can see the light from the flashlight shining on the table?

Person 1 with the flashlight?\
Person 2 at the other end of the table?\
Person 3 at one side of the table\
Person 4 at the other side of the table?

-   How does what you see here or do not see here compare with what you
    saw or did not see when the flash light was aimed at the mirror
    rather than the table?
-   Although the table may seem smooth, it is a rough surface compared
    to the mirror. What are the similarities and differences in what you
    observe when a flashlight is aimed at the mirror or at the table?
-   Under the ***During*** section of your physics notebook page, record
    your observations and interpret these results.
-   Use sketches of light rays reflecting from smooth and rough surfaces
    to explain these differences.
-   Discuss your findings and formulate central ideas about how light is
    reflected from smooth and rough surfaces. In the ***After*** section
    of the physics notebook page, report these ideas, the evidence on
    which they are based, and the rationale that connects the evidence
    to these claims and notes their importance.

To complete this exploration of reflection phenomena:

-   Using the everyday meaning of the word, reflect upon your
    experiences in exploring the nature of reflection phenomena.
-   What are you still wondering?
-   Add the central ideas about reflection from smooth and rough
    surfaces to Table I.1:

: TABLE I.1 (continued) Explorations of light phenomena: Reflection

Complete entries on your physics notebook page and Table I.1. Then write
a summary of what you have learned about reflection phenomena before
reading an example of student work in response to questions 1.18 and
1.19.

#### 1. Example of student work about reflection phenomena {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H418}

As shown in Fig. 1.27, a student added to Table 1.1 about reflection
phenomena ray diagrams for reflection from smooth and rough surfaces.
For evidence to support the two new central ideas stated, the student
wrote: "*Using the meter sticks to show where the light rays are going
we can see that the light hits the mirror and then reflects off of it at
the same angle it hits at*."

FIG. 1.27 Student's addition about reflection in Table 1.1
:::
:::

***Light rays reflect from smooth surfaces in a regular way, where the
angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence.*** *In this
experiment we used two surfaces; the smooth surface of a mirror; and the
rough wood surface of the table. We found that when the light rays
traveling in straight lines from the flashlight to the mirror hit the
mirror's surface, the light is reflected. We can see this when looking
at the face of the person on the opposite side of the table; light is
hitting her face. The angles of the line of incidence and the line of
reflection appear to be the same. For any one particular light ray the
angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.*

***Light rays bounce from rough surfaces in many directions.*** *As
demonstrated in the ray diagram, any one single ray of light that hits
the rough surface will still have an equal angle of incidence and angle
of reflection but individual rays of light hit the surface at a
different angle.*

Physics student, Fall 2015

When shining on a rough surface, the light from a flashlight can be
envisioned as rays traveling in the same direction but that direction
will form different angles of incidence with different parts of a bumpy
surface, so that the rays bounce off at many different angles of
reflection.

#### *2. Some nuances in explaining reflection phenomena* {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H419}

Defining the angles of incidence and reflection with respect to the
mirror is a choice made here because the angle between the meter stick
representing the light rays and the mirror is visually easy for children
to perceive and compare.

Physics texts typically define a different set of angles, however, for
the angle of incidence and angle of reflection. Draw a line
perpendicular to the mirror at the point that the light beam shines on
the mirror. This perpendicular line is called the *normal* line.Â  As
shown in Fig. 1.28, physicists define the angle of incidence as the
angle between the incident beam and the normal to the surface.
Physicists define the angle of reflection as the angle between the
reflected beam and the normal to the surface.

If the surface of the flat mirror were clean, only Person 2 should have
been able to see the light from the flashlight in the mirror.Â  Persons
1, 3, and 4 would not have been able to see light in the mirror if all
of the light rays incident on the mirror were being reflected at the
same angle toward Person 2's face.

If the surface of the mirror were dusty, however, some of the light rays
may have bounced off the dust in directions toward the other members of
the group and they may have reported seeing the light in the mirror. If
the classroom still uses chalk on a blackboard, one can clap an eraser
near the mirror and "see" a beam of light from the flashlight to the
mirror and from the mirror to Person 2's face as some light bounces off
the chalk dust in many directions and makes such beams visible.

When the flashlight was aimed at the table surface, all members of the
group should have been able to see light on the table as some light rays
were being reflected in many directions by the rough surface of the
table as shown in Fig. 1.29.

There are several ways to think about what happens when light shines on
rough surfaces.Â  One way is to notice what happens when a group of
people look at someone speaking in a room. Who can see that person's
nose? Can someone by the window see the speaker's nose? What about
someone over in a corner? Someone on the other side of the room? OneÂ can
infer that light is bouncing off that person's nose in many different
directions if all of these people can see that person's nose,

This visual representation of a model of light in which light rays
bounce off a surface with the angle of incidence equal to the angle of
reflection suggests a visual experience you may have had:

-   What happens when a basketball player dribbles a ball down a court?
    How does the ball bounce off the floor? Or when a tennis player
    practices by hitting a ball hard against a wall with a forehand shot
    and the ball rebounds to be hit again backhand?
-   Try this by rolling a basketball at an angle toward a wall. How does
    the basketball rebound from the wall?

Make a sketch of how balls rebound when bouncing at an angle off a floor
or wall.

-   If such a sketch is analogous to a diagram showing how light rays
    reflect from a mirror, what does this suggest about the nature of
    light?

FIG. 1.30 A ball rebounding from a surface.
:::
:::

As shown in Fig. 1.30, a ball thrown against a wall rebounds in a way
that suggests **another physical model for light:Â **envision light rays
as streams of particles traveling in straight lines and reflecting from
a surface with angle of incidence equal to angle of reflection. When
this physical model for light is used, the particles are called
*photons.* Such streams of photons can be envisioned as rays of light
reflecting from a surface with the angle of reflection equal to the
angle of incidence. Thus our initial physical model for light rays
traveling in straight lines, a meter or yard stick, can now be
elaborated as a stream of photons traveling in straight lines from a
source.

##### ***Question 1.20 How well do different materials reflect light?*** {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H520 style="text-align: center"}

Sunlight shines on many different materials such as water, sand, soil,
asphalt pavement, grass, trees, people...Â  How each material responds
depends upon the material's *properties.* Such properties include how
well the material reflects light, its *reflectivity*.

calculator to show a graph of light intensity versus time as you move
the probe over various materials. Or use a free app on a cell phone,

#### *3. Example of student work about the property of reflectivity* {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H420}

***Materials differ in the property of reflectivity, how well they
reflect light. Corollary: Materials differ in how well they absorb
light.*** *To measure the light reflectivity of different materials we
took a light sensor to the surface of different materials and recorded
them on a computer. We used the program LoggerLite which records and
graphs the amount of light being reflected off any particular surface.
We used different materials like foil, dark cloth, white paper, and even
our clothing and nothing at all; we tried just pointing the sensor
directly at the light.*

*In Figure (1.32) below you can see the different levels of reflectivity
of light. The furthest point to the left that I circled represents when
we were covering the end of the sensor with our hand; it was reflecting
no light at all.*

*The next point is circled in close to the top of the graph; this spot
in the graph represents us pointing the sensor straight at the lights
above us. There was quite a bit of reaction because we were pointing the
sensor at the direct light.*

*The next circle that I circled to focus on is close to the bottom of
the graph. This spot isn't as low as when we were covering the end of
the sensor, but we were shining the sensor at our hand, which wasn't
very reflective.*

*The next circled spot in the graph represents when we shined the sensor
at a piece of tin foil. The graph went very high telling us that this
material was very reflective.*

*The last circled section of the graph represents when we shined the
sensor on a piece of navy blue fabric. We held it here for a few seconds
and the line leveled out, telling us that the material wasn't reflective
and that this was a consistent reading.*

This student labeled both axes: "amount ofÂ  light" on the vertical axis
and "time" on the horizontal axis. The student used small circles to
direct attention to different parts of the sketched graph, based on the
graph produced by the computer as the students moved the light probe
from one material to another.Â  The student described the circle at the
origin as "when we would cover end of probe so it couldn't see light."Â 
The first labeled peak was "pointing probe at light above us;" the
second labeled peak as "foil;" and the low horizontal line as "black
paper/blue cloth."

#### 4. Some nuances about exploring the property of reflectivity {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H421}

Taking a photograph of the graph on the computer screen is helpful for
retaining accurate information. Sketching the graph is helpful for
noting important aspects, as this student did, such as the meaning of
peaks and flat lines.

The peaks in Fig. 1.32 represent pointing the probe briefly at a
reflective material; the flat lines represent pointing the probe at a
material for more than a moment. A more careful graph would have
perpendicular axes, with the same labels as those used by the computer
program and with the values represented by the vertical marks noted. One
is puzzled by how the intensity of light reflected by the foil could
have been more than the intensity of the incoming light, perhaps
identification of these peaks was switched later during preparation of
this report. Or perhaps this group was near a window and additional
light from the Sun was shining on the foil. However, this graph clearly
conveys the information that the intensity of reflected light varies
with materials.

â¢ How can you use your knowledge of reflectivity to design a solar oven?
Which two of the above materials would you choose to use?

See
<http://static.lawrencehallofscience.org/diy_sun_science/downloads/diy_ss_cook_solar_oven.pdf>Â and
[https://climatekids.nasa.gov/smores/](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/smores)Â for
examples.

This is a context within which students can participate in *engineering
design* as advocated in theÂ *Next Generation Science StandardsÂ *(NGSS
Lead States, 2013). See Appendix I at
<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices>Â . Engineering
design involves defining a problem, developing solutions, and optimizing
the solution (see pages 3-6).

**B. Exploring refraction phenomena**

When light shines on a surface, light *reflects* from the surface as
just discussed but sometimes some of the light does not. Some of the
light *refracts* instead as it keeps on traveling through the surface
into a new *medium*. The word medium refers to the substance through
which the light is traveling, such as air or water.

##### ***Question 1.21 What happens when light travels from one medium into another medium, such as from air into water or from water into air?*** {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H521}

Equipment: To explore refraction phenomena, use a pencil or stirring
rod, a tray, two paper cups, a pen, and access to some water.

-   What happens if you drop something into a pail of water? How does it
    look different if at all? What if you are swimming under water and
    look up through the water at something overhead?

Note some of your experiences with looking at objects in water in the
***Before*** section of the physics notebook page documenting your
exploration of refraction phenomena**.**

-   Make a large dot in a paper cup about a third of the way down from
    the top. Place the cup with the dot on a tray. Fill the other cup
    with water and put it on the tray.
-   Bend down until you can just see the dot in the cup. Then bend a
    little more so that you can no longer see the dot as shown in Figure
    1.33. What do you think will happen when water is poured into the
    cup and covers the dot?

Light rays bouncing off the dot in the direction toward the eye are
blocked from reaching the eye by the side of the cup near its rim.

-   Why do you see what you see? Discuss with your group members some
    ideas about why someone would see the dot appear to move in the way
    it does when water is poured into the cup and covers the dot.
-   Sometimes when one is puzzled by a phenomenon, it helps to think
    about a similar phenomenon. Put a pencil or stirrer in a glass or
    tub of water as in Fig. 1.34. What do you see?

Does the pencil appear higher or lower in the water?Â  Does the dot
appear to be higher or lower in the water in the cup?

-   How could you draw rays representing light traveling from the dot to
    the eye so that the eye would perceive the light coming from the
    "apparent dot" rather than from the real dot?
-   Discuss various possibilities with your group members. How can you
    use the technique of drawing rays to represent a straight line path
    of light in this scenario?
-   As you work together generating ways to think about explaining why
    the dot appears to be moving up as you pour water into the cup, step
    back occasionally and ask yourselves,
    -   What are we doing?
    -   Why are we doing this?
    -   How is this helping us?
-   One way to think about something puzzling is to make a sketch of
    what is happening. On a large white board, draw an outline of the
    cup without water, dot, and observer's eye just below where the
    observer could see the dot as in Fig. 1.33

Also draw an outline of the cup with water, dot, and observer's eye in
the same position.Â  Use a *dashed line* to outline where the dot
*appears to be* in the cup with water.

#### *1. Example of student work about exploring refraction phenomena* {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H422}

A student added to Table 1.1 about explorations of refraction phenomena
as shown in Fig. 1.35. The sketch is labeledÂ  "can't see dot" before the
water covers it and "can see dot" after the water is up to the top of
the cup.Â  The ray diagram shows the "original" dot with a solid line
showing the path the light traveled and the "perceived dot" with a
dotted line to show the light's apparent path.

A student stated a central idea about refraction phenomena and used it
to explain this phenomenon as follows:

***Light rays refract (bend, change direction) at the surface when light
moves from one medium into another such as from air to water or from
water to air.*** *In this experiment students had two cups. One cup was
filled with water, the second cup was empty and had a dot drawn on one
inside wall. Students were asked to crouch in front of the cup to where
they could just see the dot; then they were told to go just lower than
that. A second student poured the water from cup 1 into cup 2 and asked
the students what they saw. As the student watched the cup being filled,
water rose to the top. When the water rose above the dot on the wall of
the cup, the crouching student could see the dot once more, even though
the student had not moved.*

*The dot gave the appearance of moving up the wall of the cup. Light was
traveling to the dot the entire time it was in the cup. That is why the
students could see the dot when they were standing up and looking in the
cup and when they first crouched down...However when the student
crouched down farther the light leaving the dot was not able to reach
the student's eyes. As water rose over the dot, the light that was
leaving the dot was refracted, meaning that the light ray traveled in a
straight line under the water, but when it reached the surface of the
water and moved into another medium (from water to air) the light rays
bent traveling in many directions, one of which happened to be to the
student's eyes.*

Physics student, Fall 2015

What the student seemed to mean in the last sentence is that light rays
traveling from the dot to the surface of the water bend as they move
from the water into the air; each ray bends in a particular direction,
depending upon the direction and angle at which the ray had been
traveling in the water when it moved through the surface of the water to
the air; some of these rays happen to bend in just the right way that
they travel from the dot to the surface of the water and then, as they
enter the air, bend in the direction toward the student's eyes.

#### *2. Nuances about exploring refraction phenomena* {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H423}

A good place to start in thinking about why the dot seems to be moving
up when covered with water in the cup is with the conceptual model of
light developed so far: the central ideas that light can be envisioned
as rays moving in straight lines and that for someone to see something,
light has to get to the person's eyes. Also relevant is the central idea
that light rays bounce off a rough surface in many directions.

It is important to remember that thinking about light rays is simply a
way toÂ *envision*Â how light could be moving through the water and the
air to get to the observer's eye when the dot appears to be moving up as
water is covering the dot in the cup.

Because the dot can be seen from many different positions when looking
down at the dot in the water, the dot can be considered a rough surface.
Note that the source of the light somewhere up in the air above the cup
of water has not been included here. Thinking about what happens has
been limited to envisioning what happens after incoming light rays
bounce off the dot in many directions as shown in Fig. 1.37.

FIG. 1.37 Light rays bouncing in many directions off the real dot in the
water.
:::
:::

Envision many light rays, after bouncing off the dot, traveling at many
different angles to the surface of the water. [Choose toÂ focus only on
those light rays that happen to be traveling at an angle in the water
such that when they bend at the surface of the water they are headed in
the direction of the observer's
eye.]{style="text-decoration: underline"}

The phrase *bend at the surface of the water* does not refer to
aÂ curving path for the rays of light from the dot to the eye; this
phrase refers instead to a path represented by one straight line, from
the dot to a point on the surface, that changes direction at that point,
and continues as another straight line, representing light rays
traveling from that point on the surface of the water to the eye.

A ruler can provide a physical model of how light rays appear to be
moving in a straight line from the apparent dot to the eye as shown in
Fig. 1.38.

:::
:::

This ruler represents, however, both the actual path of light rays that
get to the eye and an apparent path from the apparent dot.

Where does the apparent path of light rays from the apparent dot turn
into the actual path of light rays to the eye?

Consider the point that represents envisioning where light from the
apparent dot crosses the surface of the water. A solid line from the
real dot to this point represents some light rays bouncing off the real
dot and traveling straight to this point in the water as shown in Fig.
1.39 where the point is labeled as the location that "Refraction"
occurs.

Making the dashed line into a solid line from this point on the surface
of the water to the eye represents envisioning light rays bending at
this point and traveling to the eye. The dotted dot at the end of the
dotted line represents the illusion of where the dot is.

The dotted line on this ray diagram represents envisioning the [apparent
path of light rays]{style="text-decoration: underline"} from the
apparent dot to the point where the actual light rays bend at the
surface.

The solid line with arrows on this ray diagram represents envisioning
the [actual path of light rays]{style="text-decoration: underline"}Â from
the dot to the surface of the water, the sharp bend at the surface, and
the solid line from that point at the surface to the eye.

It is helpful to think about examples of refraction in a variety of
contexts. In some positions, for example, a pencil or a stick looks like
it is bending at the surface of the water as in Fig. 1.40. Why does it
look bent?

As shown in Fig 1.40, light is envisioned as shining on a pencil in the
water and bouncing off in many directions. Some of the rays are
envisioned as bouncing off the pencil and traveling in straight lines
toward the surface of the water. At the surface, these rays are
envisioned as bending as they move into air. Some of the rays are
envisioned to be bending in such a way that they travel straight to the
observer's eye. The observer perceives the rays as if they had traveled
in a straight line from a location different from where the actual
pencil is located so the person perceives the pencil to be bent.

##### ***Question 1.22 What happens when exploring refraction with friends and/or family members?*** {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H522}

#### *3. Exploring refraction phenomena with a friend or family member* {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H424}

After class, our students have explored refraction phenomena with
friends and/or family members and reflected upon this experience by
describing details about what their learners ask, say, Â do, and find.
They also have commented upon what they learn about learning and
teaching science through this experience. A student, for example, wrote:

*When I originally showed the phenomena to my roommate L, she said
"whoa, when did you start doing magic tricks!" I laughed and told her
that I was not doing magic but merely working with the phenomena of
refractions.*

*She asked "what is refraction?" I told her it was what allowed her to
see the dot. I then showed her the experiment again. Afterwards I had
her stand and asked if she could see the dot, she said "yes." I asked
why, and she said because she was standing high enough. So, I turned off
the lights and asked if she could see it. She said "No!" I turned back
on the lights and asked what she must have to see the dot and she said
"I need light to see the dot." So I kept the lights on and covered the
dot so only I could look into the cup and see it. I asked if she could
see the dot, the light was there so she should be able to. L then told
me that the "light needs to hit the dot and then come to my eyes, I
can't see it if you block the light from getting to my eyes."*

*So I asked L what must have happened for the light to travel from the
dot, which was below her line of sight and go to her eyes. "Well," said
L "the dot didn't move, cause that is impossible. So the light must have
moved in the water to get to my eyes. Cause I only saw the dot look like
it moved up after the water covered it."*

*At this point L was so close that it was very hard for me to not just
tell her the answer. I refrained, but only barely. I asked L how she
thought the light was moving; she said she didn't know.*

*So I drew out the flat ray diagram with the image of the dot on the
side of the cup and her eye where it could not see the dot, but I did
not draw the rays of light. I asked L to draw what she thought was
happening. L drew a curved line from the dot to her eye.*

*Once again L was so close that it was hard not to give the answer away.
So I asked L how light travels, she said "in rays, like the rays of the
sun". I was surprised that she knew this but I was glad. So I asked her
to show me a ray, a straight line leaving the dot and going to the
surface of the water. She did so.*

*I asked if she thought this was how the light might have moved; she
said, "well maybe, because the water going over the dot was what bent
the light, so maybe the light only bends when it leaves the surface of
the water." I was thrilled! She had figured it out! I then showed L the
ray diagram of how light refracts and bends towards our eyes when
leaving the surface of the water and going into the air.*

*The experience was hard for me. It was difficult for me to try and
explain a concept to someone that was a new concept for me as well.
However, it was rewarding to see that if I was patient, and continued to
ask questions and only give small supplementary bits of information that
L was able to understand the phenomena.*

*It was hard to try and think in a way that would foster L's own
thinking about how the light rays traveled and to try and form questions
that would help L to think in a certain way about light. I believe this
will be much of what I feel as a teacher later. I will need to think of
many different approaches for my students. Not all of them will
understand instantly why a phenomena works; they will need more guidance
or more questions, they may even need to experiment on their own to see
if they can understand. I as a teacher must learn not to rush this
process and to allow them to learn about the subjects themselves. This
is in the hopes that the students will remember more about the
information as well as be more interested in the learning process.*

#### *4. Thoughts about the nature of science exemplified by these explorations* {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H425}

The explorations of light phenomena so far exemplify the nature of
science in that students developed central ideas based on evidence and
modified those ideas as necessary after observing new phenomena.
Initially, for example, explorations of light and shadow phenomena
provided the basis for development of a conceptual model of light that
included the central ideas that (a) *light leaves a source in all
directions*, which, after discussion and additional exploration, was
modified to *light leaves a point on most sources in many directions.*
Additional explorations provided evidence for the central ideas that
Â (b) l*ight can be envisioned as rays traveling in straight lines*, and
(c) Â f*or someone to see something, light has to get to the person's
eye*. A ray diagram representing how rays seemed to travel in straight
lines was useful in developing an explanation of an intriguing
observation, that the projection of an object in a pinhole camera was
upside down. Â A straight meter or yard stick provided a physical model
for thinking about light as behaving like rays traveling in straight
lines.

Additional explorations of reflection and refraction phenomena, however,
provided evidence that this conceptual model needed further revision.
Observations of these phenomena provided evidence for development of
three additional central ideas that refer to what happens when light
shines on surfaces: c) that *light rays can be envisioned as being
reflected from smooth surfaces with the angle of reflection equaling the
angle of incidence*, d) that *light rays can be envisioned as bouncing
off of rough surfaces in many directions*, and e) that *light rays can
be envisioned as refracting (bending, changing direction) at the surface
when traveling through a surface from one medium to another*. These are
examples of the on-going nature ofÂ *s*cientific knowledge, which is
*open to revision in light of new evidence* and *can change when new
information is found (NGSS, Lead States, 2013,* Appendix
H*).*<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices>

A bouncing ball also provided an elaborated physical model for light as
rays composed of particles (photons) traveling in straight lines until
interacting with a surface. More complex ray diagrams were useful in
explaining another intriguing phenomenon, the apparent upward movement
of a dot on the inside of a cup as water is poured into the
cup.Â Additional modifications of this conceptual model for light may
become necessary after exploring more phenomena. Meanwhile we turn next
to elaborating experience with refraction phenomena in a new context.

### **C. Exploring dispersion phenomena** {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H315}

In this section, we explore light phenomena known as dispersion.

As shown in Fig. 1.42, a student added to Table 1.1 about explorations
of light phenomena and stated as evidence, "White light from the Sun hit
the prism and was broken up into its different colors."

FIG. 1.42 Student's addition to Table 1.1 about exploring dispersion
phenomena:
:::
:::

The student summarized this new central idea about dispersion phenomena
as follows:

***White light disperses into its component colors when moving from one
medium into another such as from air into a prism or water.*** *For this
experiment, students were given triangular prisms made of a clear
material that may have been glass. We were then taken outside into the
sunshine and told to move our prisms around and see what happened.*

*Â Â Â Â Â  It took a moment before someone exclaimed, "Hey I see a rainbow!"
Soon many students began to really watch what happened when they tilted
the prisms one way or another. Some students placed a piece of white
paper on the ground and tried to project the "rainbows" onto the paper.
When students set the prisms onto the paper facing the sun we were able
to see two figures that looked like shadows but much lighter. It was
light being dispersed through the prism onto the paper.*

*Â Â Â Â Â  When we moved the prism slightly we were able to see the light on
the paper change from a slight white color to the rainbow of colors Red
Orange Yellow Green Blue and Violet (ROYGBIV).*

*Â Â Â Â Â  The students then talked about what must be happening and our
TA's told us that the sun sends out a kind of light called white light
that holds all of the colors of the rainbow in it. The students decided
that what must happen is that as the light passes through the prism it
is broken up into the different colors when it is sent back out of the
prism. This experiment is represented in a picture on (Fig. 1.41) as
well as a ray diagram. In the ray diagram light goes into one side of
the prism, where it is broken up into the many colors, and then
dispersed on the other side into the different colors that were seen by
the students.*

Physics student, Fall 2015

#### *2. Nuances about exploring dispersion phenomena* {#chapter-007-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U1H427}

Figure 1.43 shows red and violet rays bending as they move from air into
a prism and bending again as they move from the prism back into air. The
violet rays bend more than the red rays and this difference separates
the white light into its component colors. The colors between red and
violet bend intermediate amounts.

Note that the orientation of the two surfaces of the prism differ, one
side slants toward the left, the other side slants toward the right. If
one draws a line perpendicular to the surface of the prism (a normal
line) at the point where the white light enters the prism, the rays bend
*toward* this normal as they move from air into the prism.

If one draws a line perpendicular to the surface of the prism at the
point where each ray leaves the prism, the rays are bending *away* from
the normal as they move from the prism back out to the air. The result
of the different orientations of these surfaces is that the rays keep
bending "down" as they enter and then leave the prism.

The drawing shows rays of light as they are inferred to be traveling.
One can not actually "see" these colored rays as represented in the
drawing. What one sees is the spectrum of colors when the rays land on
some kind of screen such as a wall or piece of paper, or in the case of
a rainbow, on the retina of an eye. This is aÂ *model* of what seems to
be happening. The next section uses this model to develop an explanation
for an amazing natural event, the formation of a rainbow.

and dispersion to explain a beautiful phenomenon: a rainbow.

##### ***Question 1.24 How are rainbows formed?*** {#chapter-008-using-additional-powerful-ideas-about-light-to-explain-an-intriguing-phenomenon.html#U1H524 style="text-align: center"}

-   When you see a rainbow, where are you standing with respect to where
    the sun and rain are?
    -   Is the sun behind you, high above you, or in front of you?
    -   Is the rain behind you, raining straight down on you, or some
        distance away in front of you?
    -   Make a sketch that shows where you are with respect to the sun
        and rain.
-   What happens when light from the sun enters a water drop?
    -   What happens when light rays move from one medium into another
        such as from air into water?
    -   Make a ray diagram showing white rays from the sun entering a
        water drop.\
        Show only one color as rays of that color move from air into the
        drop.

-   What happens when light rays reflect off a smooth surface?
    -   Continue your ray diagram showing rays of one color reflecting
        off of the inner surface of the drop, back into the drop.

    as from water into air?
    -   Continue your ray diagram showing rays of one color leaving the

-   Will colors from the same drop reach the observer's eye?
    -   Continue your ray diagram showing rays of one color traveling to
        the observer's eye.
    -   Consider whether rays of another color would exit this drop in a
        direction toward the observer's eye.
    -   Add another drop at a different height from which a different
        color reaches the observer's eye.
-   Summarize how light from the sun sometimes forms a rainbow in the
    sky.

#### *1. Example of student work explaining rainbows* {#chapter-008-using-additional-powerful-ideas-about-light-to-explain-an-intriguing-phenomenon.html#U1H428}

A student began explaining rainbows with a sketch of where someone is
who is seeing a rainbow, with respect to the sun and the rain, and a ray
diagram showing how one can envision what happens when light rays enter
water drops in just the right way to form a rainbow as shown in Fig.
1.44.

*(Figure 1.44) is a sketch of someone seeing a rainbow. The Sun is
behind the person and the cloud with raindrops is in front of the
person.*

FIG. 1.45 Student ray diagram for two raindrops and person seeing a
rainbow.
:::
:::

*The ideas above can be used in tracing the two continuous rays in (Fig.
1.45), in order to explain how someone can see a rainbow.*

*First of all, white light disperses into its component colors when
moving from one medium into another such as from air into a prism or
water.*

*In Figure (1.45), the two light rays that are shown leaving the sun in
the direction of the raindrops are white light. Once those white light
rays hit the raindrops, which is a change in medium from air to water,
it can be seen that the white light disperses into its component colors,
which is represented by the red and violet rays seen inside of the
raindrops. Next, light rays refract (bend, change direction) at the
surface when light moves from one medium into another such as from air
to water or from water to air. This refraction is first seen in Figure
(1.45) in each of the raindrops directly when the light rays first hit
the raindrops, since the rays are moving from the medium of air to the
medium of water.*

*Next, light rays reflect from smooth surfaces in a regular way, where
the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. This is seen in
Figure (1.45) when both the red and the violet rays hit the back of the
raindrops, which are smooth surfaces, and they reflect off in the same
angles as which they came in, which are the angles of incidence.*

*Finally, refraction is seen again in Figure (1.45). The second time
that refraction is seen is when the light rays are leaving the
raindrops, since the rays are moving from the medium of water to the
medium of air. When the light rays leave the raindrops, the red rays
bend less than the violet rays. So, in the raindrop on the top, only the
red Â light rays exit at the correct angle to travel to the observer's
eye. In the raindrop on the bottom, only the violet light rays exit at
the correct angle to travel to the observer's eye. Since we only see one
color from each raindrop, that is how a rainbow is seen.*

#### *2. Nuances in using central ideas about reflection, refraction, and dispersion* *to explain rainbows* {#chapter-008-using-additional-powerful-ideas-about-light-to-explain-an-intriguing-phenomenon.html#U1H429}

A step by step view of the processes involved in forming rainbows can be
helpful:

Â 

First the white light rays from the Sun are envisioned as
beingÂ **refracted** on entering a water drop with different colors
bending at different angles. Violet bends the most, red the least. The
other colors bend in between. Figure 1.46 shows this first step of white
light entering a raindrop and one of its component colors bending toward
the normal at a particular angle at the surface of the drop.

FIG. 1.46 White light ray from the Sun **refracts** as it enters a
raindrop.
:::
:::

Next the colored light ray is envisioned as moving through the rain drop
and encountering the inner surface of the other side of the raindrop.Â 
What happens there?

FIG. 1.47 Light ray of a particular color is **reflected** at the smooth
inner surface of the rain drop.
:::
:::

As shown in Fig. 1.47, when rays of a particular color enter a drop,
they are envisioned as bending and continuing to move in a straight line
in a direction away from the observer until they reach the smooth inner
surface of the raindrop.Â  As shown in Fig. 1.47, some are envisioned as
beingÂ **reflected** internally at the inside surface, where angle of
reflection equals the angle of incidence for each color.Â  These rays are
envisioned as now heading back in a direction toward the observer.

Â 

Then the rays of all colors are envisioned as moving back through the
raindrop to the original side they entered, but now traveling in the
opposite direction. What happens there?

::: {#chapter-008-using-additional-powerful-ideas-about-light-to-explain-an-intriguing-phenomenon.html#caption-attachment-2192 .wp-caption-text}
FIG. 1.48 Light ray of a particular color is **refracted** again as it
moves from water into air.
:::
:::

As shown in Figure 1.48, rays of this color are envisioned as
beingÂ **refracted** again as they leave the raindrop in the direction of
the observer, bending again, but away from the normal at a particular
angle for that color.Â  The red rays leave the surface below the green
rays, which are below the blue rays.Â  This is the inverse order to
colors seen in a rainbow.

Â 

As shown in Fig. 1.48, the entire trip through a rain drop is envisioned
as involving a) **refraction** as white light enters the raindrop and
separates into its component colors as each color bends at its own
angle, b) **reflection** of each color at the opposite inner surface
with color's angle of reflection equal to its angle of incidence, and
then c) **refraction** again but in a direction toward the observer as
the rays of each color leave the raindrop.

Note that if you see a rainbow you are seeing light from DIFFERENT
raindrops.Â  The red light is coming from drops high in the sky, the
violet light from drops lower in the sky (See:
<http://science.howstuffworks.com/nature/climate-weather/atmospheric/question41.htm>).

Figure 1.49 shows a ray diagram drawn by Rebecca McDowell when she was a
second year Bachelor of Teaching student at the University of Melbourne,
Victoria, Australia. She included many colors of the spectrum and
represented someone seeing different colors from raindrops at different
heights.

As shown on the right in Fig. 1.50, the order of the colors in the faint
secondary bow of a double rainbow is reversed with red light forming the
inner arc. The explanation involves a similar model of envisioning light
rays from the Sun refracting, reflecting, and refracting as they enter
and leave raindrops. In a secondary bow of a double rainbow, however,
the incoming refracted light rays are envisioned as reflecting twice
within a raindrop rather than once[,

#### *Historical interpretations of the spectrum of colors dispersed by a prism* {#chapter-009-historical-and-current-perspectives-on-the-nature-of-light.html#U1H430}

Archeologists have found glass prisms in ancient Roman ruins as well as
natural prisms such as rock crystals in Pompeii (Rossi & Russo, 2017, p.
335). These findings suggest that people have been seeing a spectrum of
colors displayed when white light shines through a prism since ancient
times. Greek and Roman writers also discussed optical phenomena. Euclid
(325 BC-265 BC), for example, envisioned light as rays moving in
straight lines, formulated a law of reflection, and knew about
refraction effects (Mach, 1926/2003, p. 3-4).

People also have pondered the nature of light and colors for a long
time. The Greek philosopher Aristotle (384 BC-322 BC), for example,
wrote that colors were mixtures of light (white) and darkness (black).
This became widely accepted and led to the view that light from the Sun
was a single form of light, white, and that a prism modified pure white
light into the different colors as the white light moved through the
prism.

This view of white light persisted until the publication of a letter to
the Royal Society of London in 1671/72 by Isaac Newton. He stated and
supported a different view, that white light was already a mixture of
colors, with each color bending as it entered a prism at its own angle
of refraction.

Newton (1671/72) referred to refraction as "refrangibility" and stated
that:

*As the Rays of light differ in degrees of Refrangibility, so they also
differ in their disposition to exhibit this or that particular
colour...The least Refrangible Rays are all disposed to exhibit red
colour, and contrarily those Rays, which are disposed to exhibit a Red
colour, are all the least refrangible: So, the most refrangible Rays are
all disposed to exhibit a deep Violet Colour, and contrarily those which
are apt to exhibit such a violet colour, are all the most Refrangible.
And so to all the intermediate colours in a continued series belong
intermediate degrees of refrangibility. (p. 3081, \#1 and \#2)
Â <https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rstl.1671.0072>*

In addition, Newton noted that when we perceive an object to have a
particular color, that effect is due to the object primarily reflecting
light of that color to our eyes:

*...the Colours of all natural Bodies have no other origin than this,
that they are variously qualified to reflect one sort of light in
greater plenty than another. And this I have experimented in a dark Room
by illuminating those bodies with uncompounded light of divers
colours...and consequently when illuminated with day-light, that is,
with all sorts of Rays of any colour promiseuously blended, those
qualified with red shall abound most in the reflect light, and by their
prevalence cause it to appear of that colour (ibid, p. 3084-3085, \#13)*

Newton claimed that the colored rays already existed within the white
light and that these rays separate as they bend at different angles
within the prism (p. 3083, \#7). To support this claim, Newton showed
that not only did a prism disperse white light into separate colors but
also that a lens could converge these colored rays back into white light
like that that comes from the Sun. He presented evidence for this claim
by describing his experimental setup and findings:

*In a darkened room make a hole in the shut of a window, whose diameter
may conveniently be about third part of an inch, to admit a convenient
quantity of the Suns light: And there place a clear and colourless
Prisme, to refract the entering light towards the further part of the
Room, which, as I said, will thereby be diffused into an oblong coloured
Image. Then place a Lens of about three-foot radius (suppose a broad
Object-glass of a three foot Telescope,) at the distance of about four
or five foot from thence, through which all those colours may at once be
transmitted, and made by its Refraction to convene at a further distance
of about ten or twelve feet. If at that distance you intercept this
light with a sheet of white paper, you will see the colours converted
into whiteness again by being mingled.*

He provided some details of how to do this and suggestions of what to
observe:

*But it is requisite, that the Prisme and Lens be placed steddy, and
that the paper, on which the colours are cast, be moved to and fro; for,
by such motion, you will not only find, at what distance the whiteness
is most perfect, but also see, how the colours gradually convene, and
vanish into whiteness, and afterwards having crossed one another in that
place where they compound Whiteness, are again dissipated, and severed,
and in an inverted order retain the same colours, which they had before
they entered the composition...(ibid., p. 3086)*

Newton also provided the ray diagram reproduced in Figure 1.51 to
illustrate this experiment. In Figure 1.51, rays of white light from the
sun (SF) enter a hole in a window (EG), pass through an equilateral
prism (ABC), and are dispersed, with example rays FP bent more than FR.
Lens (mn) converges these rays so that they meet at point Q on paper HI
as white light, although they are seen as colored spots before and after
Q if the paper HI is moved back and forth. (This excerpt from the letter
also includes some of the text, in which the font for s looks like an
f.)

Newton also applied this understanding to explain the colors in the
rainbow (\#10 on pages 3083-3084). We too can use what we now know about
reflection, refraction, and dispersion to make sense of why we sometimes
can see beautiful rainbows in the sky.

In addition to referring to light as rays, Newton envisioned rays as
composed of "small particles". In a later major document summarizing his
exploration of light phenomena, the bookÂ *Opticks,Â *he wrote:

*Are not the Rays of Light very small Bodies emitted from shining
Substances? (p. 371, Question 29)*

Inflections and Colours of Light.* (4th ed.) London: William Innys at

Christiaan Huygens (1690), a Dutch contemporary of Newton, however,
proposed an alternative way of envisioning light, as analogous to sound,
traveling outward in all directions from a source like a wave formed
when a pebble drops into a puddle of water:

*It (light) spreads, as Sound does, by spherical surfaces and waves: for
I call them waves from their resemblance to those which are seen to be
formed in water when a stone is thrown into it, and which present a
successive spreading as circles, though these arise from another cause,
and are only in a flat surface.(p. 4)*

Envisioning light as such successive spreading of circular waves also
occurs today. Light waves can be represented as shown in Figure 1.53,
which presents the primary colors of the spectrum of light from the sun.
Red light has the largest wavelength, violet the smallest.

As shown in Fig. 1.54, aÂ *wave length*, often represented by the Greek
letter *lambda*Â can be measured from crest to crest, midpoint to
midpoint, or trough to trough. The wave's *amplitude* is the distance
from the midpoint to the crest or trough.

The light's *frequency*, often represented by f or the Greek letter
*nuÂ *is the number of waves that pass a point each second. The *speed*
of a wave depends on both the wavelength Â and the frequency:Â 
![\\text{(speed)} =
\\text{(wavelength)(frequency)}](OEBPS/assets/c35ed3b94d15dedb79bfc5e3cd18d055.png "\text{(speed)} = \text{(wavelength)(frequency)}"){.latex
.mathjax}.

These two perspectives on what light IS, whether particles or waves,
were evident in the writings of Newton and Huygens in the 17th century.
They continue today in the "wave-particle duality'' to which physicists
refer. Sometimes it is helpful to think of light as a stream of
particles, sometimes as a spreading wave. Each perspective is useful,
depending upon the context within which one is asking questions about
light.

What does it meanÂ *to doÂ *science? What should every person know about
science? How should science be taught? These are questions that every
community decides by what and how children learn science, or not, in its
schools.

This section completes this unit. As an informed citizen, you should
become aware of your community's standards for teaching science,
particularly if you are a teacher, preparing to become a teacher, or a
parent advocating for more science to be taught in elementary schools.

The *Next Generation Science StandardsÂ *[(NGSS) website is at
<https://www.nextgenscience.org> . This website describes three
dimensions of what it means to be proficient in science and engineering.
These dimensions areÂ ]{style="font-size: 1em"}*science and engineering
practices, crosscutting concepts, and disciplinary core ideasÂ *[that
NGSS recommends for students to learn at various grade
levels.]{style="font-size: 1em"}

This unit began, for example, with the scientific practice of *asking
questions* about the nature of light such as *How does light seem to
travel from a source to a screen?* By exploring light and shadows,
students developed a model for thinking about light, that *light can be
envisioned as rays traveling in straight lines*. Students next used that
model to explain the *cause* of a surprising *effect*, that the
projection on the screen of a pinhole camera is upside down. Searching
for the *cause of an effect* is a *crosscutting concept* characteristic
of the many domains of science and engineering.Â During explorations in
this unit, students inferred and used a *disciplinary core idea* that
*objects can be seen when light reflected from their surfaces enters our
eyes.*

Development of the *Next Generation Science Standards* was based on an
earlier document, *A Framework for K-12 Education: Practices,
Crosscutting Concepts, and Core
IdeasÂ *(<https://www.nap.edu/read/13165/chapter/1>). The NGSS website

*(The table) indicates with a check mark my perception of participating
in some way in some of the eight practices specified during my
exploration of light phenomena...One of the practices that we have
participated in during class is developing and using models and we did
this when we developed the idea that light can be envisioned as rays
traveling in straight lines. In order to do this, we used a lamp, a
barrier, a white piece of paper, and a meter stick. The light shined
directly on the barrier, so the barrier made a shadow on the white
paper. The meter stick was placed at the edge of the lamp and it went
straight past the edge of the barrier. The meter stick represents a ray
of light traveling from the lamp. The shadow of the meter stick was
lined up with the edge of the barrier's shadow on the paper, which we
inferred means that the light travels in a straight line because the
shadows lined up perfectly in relation to the actual objects, so we
assume that light can always be envisioned as rays traveling in straight
lines. Developing and using a model allowed us to develop a very
important Â idea.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

### **B. Reflecting upon this exploration of light phenomena** {style="text-align: center"}

This unit began with exploring light and shadows in order to develop
ways to think and talk about the nature of light. The first
demonstration involved turning on a lamp in a dark room and observing
light shining all around on the ceiling, the floor, and people's faces.
The first central idea to emerge from discussing this demonstration
likely seemed obvious, that *light leaves a source in all directions*.
This central idea needed refinement, however, to acknowledge that
directional sources like lasers exist and that not all directions might
occur. The refined central idea becameÂ *light leaves most sources in
many directions*. Small group explorations with a light source, barrier,
and screen included using a meter stick (or ruler) to serve as a
physical model representing the central idea that *light can be
envisioned as rays traveling in straight line*s.

These two central ideas formed a conceptual model useful in explaining
an intriguing phenomenon: if one looks at a light bulb through a pinhole
camera, the projection of the light bulb is upside down! A good way to
start thinking about such puzzling phenomena is to make a sketch of the
situation, in this case, to draw a picture of the light bulb and a
picture of its upside-down projection. The next step is to think about
what one knows that is relevant to the situation shown in the sketch.
For example, how can envisioning light as rays leaving a source in
straight lines help here? In particular, how can the physical model, the
meter stick (or ruler), help to think about how light from the top of
the light bulb can travel through the pinhole toward the bottom of the
screen?

Laying one end of the meter stick (or ruler) near the sketch of the top
of the bulb and the other end of the meter stick (or ruler) near the
sketch of the bottom of the projection suggests a useful insight: that
if light rays from any [point]{style="text-decoration: underline"} on
the bulb can be envisioned as leaving the source in many directions,
some rays from the top of the bulb can be thought of as traveling
straight through the pinhole toward the bottom of the screen; some rays
from the middle of the bulb can be thought of as traveling straight
through the pinhole to the middle of the screen; and some rays from the
bottom of the bulb can be thought of as traveling straight through the
pinhole toward the top of the screen. This insight implies that an
alternative explanation is not needed, that something happens to the
rays to "flip" the projection. The physical model of the meter stick (or
ruler) suggests that [nothing]{style="text-decoration: underline"}
happens to the rays forming the projection; they just keep traveling in
the same direction they happen to be going, straight through the
pinhole. The aluminum foil around the pinhole blocks other rays from the
source from shining on the screen.

Simplifying a sketch can help make important aspects of a situation more
prominent. Drawing a vertical line representing the bulb and a parallel
vertical line representing an upside-down projection, for example,
provides a useful visual model for pinhole phenomena, the *ray diagram*.
Tracing the rays with one's finger while telling the story represented
by a ray diagram can be a compelling way to communicate to others what
one is envisioning to be happening.

The ray diagram for pinhole phenomena consists of two similar triangles.
Interpreting these geometrically leads to a mathematical model for
pinhole phenomena, an algebraic equation that expresses the direct
relationship between ratios of the corresponding lengths of the similar
triangles. This mathematical model made possible estimating a quantity
that could not be directly measured. Students held a pinhole in a sheet
of aluminum foil one meter away from a screen, traced the Sun's
projection on the screen, measured the diameter of the projection, and
used the equal ratios of corresponding lengths of similar triangles as
well as information about the distance from the Earth to the Sun to
estimate the Sun's diameter.

Exploring reflection phenomena with a mirror and two meter sticks or
rulers in a dark room prompted a refinement of this ray model for light.
*Light rays can be envisioned as traveling in straight lines until they
hit a mirror and bounce away, with the angle of reflection equaling the
angle of incidence*. Balls also bounce off walls and floors in this way,
which suggests an elaboration of this model for light, that *rays can be
envisioned as an on-going flow of particles, called photons, in straight
lines*. An alternative model, representing light as waves, also can be
helpful in explaining complex phenomena, as discussed in Unit 4.

Exploring refraction and dispersion phenomena prompted an additional
refinement of this conceptual ray model for light. *When light rays move
from one medium into another, such as from air into water or from water
into air, the rays can be envisioned as traveling in straight lines that
bend at the point of entering or leaving a medium. White light from the
Sun can be envisioned as composed of many colors, with the degree of
bending related to the color of the ray*. This refined conceptual model
of light was powerful in explaining a complex phenomenon: rainbows!

### **C. Making connections to NGSS understandings about the nature of science** {style="text-align: center"}

This unit has provided many examples of the nature of science as
articulated in Appendix H of theÂ *Next Generation Science
StandardsÂ *(NGSS, Lead States,
2013)Â <https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices> .
Appendix H includes tables that provide insights about the development
of these understandings about the nature of science across grade spans
of K-2, 3-5 (elementary), 6-8 (middle school), and 9-12 (high school).
Four NGSS understandings about the nature of science are related to the
science and engineering practices.

One NGSS understanding about the nature of science, for example, is that
s*cientific investigations use a variety of methods.* Children in grades
K-2, for example, should understand that *scientists use different ways
to study the world.*Â In this unit, for example, students have made
observations using lamps, barriers, pinhole cameras, mirrors, cups of
water, and prisms to explore what happens when light moves from one
place to another.

Another NGSS understanding is that s*cientific knowledge is based on
empirical evidence.Â *Students in grades 3-5, for example, should learn
thatÂ *science findings are based on recognizing patterns.* In this unit,
for example, studentsÂ have explored patterns in what happens to shadows
when someone moves a barrier closer or farther away from a light source.

Students experience in several ways the NGSS understanding that
s*cientific knowledge is open to revision in light of new evidence.*
Students in grades 6-8 (middle school), for example, should learn
thatÂ *science explanations are subject to revision and improvement in
light of new evidence.* In this unit, theÂ central idea thatÂ *lightÂ can
be envisioned as rays traveling in straight lines,* for example,was
modified as the students explored what happens when light reflects from
a mirror, refracts when entering and leaving a new material, and
disperses if the light is composed of more than one color

K-8 development of the NGSS understanding that s*cience models, laws,
mechanisms, and theories explain natural phenomena* ranges, for
example*, from*Â s*cientists use drawings, sketches, and models as a way
to communicate ideas* (K-2) to s*ciencetheories are based on a body of
evidence developed over time (m*iddle school). In this unit, for
example, students have learned how to use ray diagrams and central ideas
based on evidence to explain a variety of phenomena. They also have had
access to original descriptions of investigations of light conducted
over several centuries.

When light from the Sun shines on the Earth, things often get hot. This
unit explores the nature of such thermal phenomena. Why, for example, do
some things feel hot or cold? What is the difference between heat and
temperature? How is energy conserved when mixing hot and cold water?
While exploring the nature of thermal phenomena, you will be:

-   ***identifying resources*** such as relevant language you use and
    experiences you have had
-   ***developing central ideas based on evidence*** that you record in
    exploring how energy flows from hot to cold objects
-   ***explaining an intriguing phenomenon*** such as why you might
    prefer sitting on wooden rather than metal risers in watching a
    soccer game late in the fall
-   ***developing mathematical representations*** of the transfer of
    energy in various contexts
-   ***using mathematical representations to estimate a quantity of
    interest*** such as how much cold water to add to a cup of tea too
    hot to drink and
-   ***making connections to educational policy***, such as theÂ *Next
    Generation Science Standards* (NGSS Lead States, 2013), the science
    standards adopted by many US departments of education.

During this unit, you will be learning about learning processes as well
as about physics as you summarize and reflect upon your explorations.
Also important will be integrating science and literacy learning such as
speaking clearly, listening closely, writing coherently, reading with
comprehension, and creating and critiquing media.

The main sections of the text present questions with suggestions for
exploring topics and for writing reflections about your findings. Text
in gray font indicates that these are suggestions; you may think of
other ways to explore the topic. You are encouraged to ask and explore
your own questions about thermal phenomena as well as those posed here.
Check with your instructor if you choose to devise an alternative
approach.

Much of the learning will occur within small groups as you and your
group members talk with one another about what you are thinking and
why.Â Keeping track of what one is doing and thinking is important. This
course uses a template for a physics notebook page on which to record
notes during class. The physics notebook page can help you remember your
thoughts *before, during,* and *after* an exploration. An experienced
elementary teacher, Adam Devittt, designed this notebook page to mirror
the structure of *before, during,* and *after*Â reading strategies.

[Before]{style="text-decoration: underline"} starting an exploration,
think about and discuss with your group members what you know already
about the topic, what questions you are asking, how you plan to conduct
the exploration, and what you think you might find out.

[During]{style="text-decoration: underline"} your exploration, record
what is happening, what you are observing, and what you are thinking
about what you are observing. Include sketches of equipment and
observations. Note any words that are new and their definitions.

[After]{style="text-decoration: underline"} your exploration, record any
central ideas that have emerged from your observations and discussions.
Also note the evidence on which you have based these ideas. In addition,
provide a rationale that states explicitly how the evidence is relevant
and supports the claims you are making in stating the central ideas.
Also explain why this result is important. Then write a reflection about
whatever you want to remember about this experience. In addition,
briefly state what you are still wondering in this context.

After class, use your physics notebook pages and any handouts to write a
summary of your exploration and findings. Writing such a summary after
every class is a good way to prepare for the midterm and final
examinations.

Next, to be sure you have understood the physics involved, read this
text and some examples of student work. The student authors first wrote
drafts, received feedback for ways to enhance content and clarity, and
submitted these final versions. Also read about some nuancesÂ to consider
when explaining the phenomena explored.

You also may find helpful student reflections about teaching a friend or
family member about what they had just learned in class, historical
information about ways knowledge about the topic developed, and some
relevant aspects of the nature of science in the context of the topic
explored. These sections of the text may broaden your understanding of
science and of science learning and teaching.

Young children learn to stay away from hot stoves, to get mittens when
going outside to play in the snow, and to sip carefully before drinking
from a cup of hot cocoa when they come back inside. Such experiences can
serve as resources on which to build when studying about thermal
phenomena.

### A. Connecting to what one already knows about thermal phenomena {#chapter-013-identifying-student-resources-2.html#U2H31}

One way to begin learning about a topic is to consider relevant everyday
experiences and the language used to describe them:

##### ***Question 2.1* *What are some everyday experiences you have had with thermal phenomena?*** {#chapter-013-identifying-student-resources-2.html#U2H51 style="text-align: center"}

-   How do you keep things hot or cold for a picnic?
-   Adjust the temperature of water for a bath?
-   Cook dinner?

Like many English words**,** the adjective *thermal* derives from a
Greek root, in this case: *thÃ©rme,* which refers to *heat*.

-   What words with the root thÃ©rme do you know?
    -   What do you use to measure temperatures?
    -   How do you keep a liquid hot or cold?
    -   What controls how much heat a furnace delivers to a room?
    -   What is the medical condition in which a person loses heat
        faster than the body can produce heat?

Everyday experiences with thermal phenomena may include using
*thermometers* to measure temperatures, storing hot or cold liquids in a
*thermo*s, adjusting a *thermosta*t to increase or decrease the amount
of heat delivered to a room, and taking care to avoid *hypothermia*
while hiking in cold and/or wet weather.

The formal name for the focus of this unit is *thermodynamics.* This is
the study of energy in the form of heat (*thermo*) and ways such energy
flows within a system (its *dynamics*). Thermodynamics is the study of
what happens when things warm up or cool down.

-   Record some of your experiences with thermal phenomena before
    reading examples of student work.

#### *1. Examples of student work identifying everyday connections to thermal phenomena* {#chapter-013-identifying-student-resources-2.html#U2H41}

A student reflected on relevant resources as follows:

*Â Â Â Â Â  The elementary students in my classroom will experience thermal
phenomena in their everyday lives. They will experience the warmth of
the sun on their faces, the coldness of metal handrails in the winter,
and hot pavement in the summer.Â  Students who take baths may also be
aware of what happens when you combine a lot of hot water with some cold
water -- the water temperature lowers, but is still on the warmer side.*

Physics Student, Spring 2015

Another student wrote about an early experience that she had had:

*I can remember being a young child and running to be the first in my
classroom so that I could get a good seat. The good seat was not only
close to the front, but it was a wooden chair, so it did not feel as
cold as some of the metal and plastic chairs in the room.*

Physics student, Fall 2015

Such memories provide useful examples of thermal phenomena to be
explained.

### **B. Documenting initial ideas with diagnostic questions about thermal phenomena** {#chapter-013-identifying-student-resources-2.html#U2H32}

One way we make sense of the world is through observations, what we see,
hear, smell, taste, and feel. These observations provide evidence that
we can think about and interpret in different ways. The diagnostic
questions below document some of your initial ideas about thermal
phenomena and will not be graded.

    an aluminum pie pan, steel can opener, Styrofoam or paper cup, and
    wooden salad fork -- or four blocks made of such materials: an

What does it mean to develop an idea based on *evidence*? This is a
practice central to doing science, to observe phenomena closely, record
findings, and make sense of these results in ways that explain what is
happening. Why, for example, would a child seek as a "good seat" a chair
made out of wood rather than metal?

### **A. Developing central ideas about thermal phenomena** {#chapter-014-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U2H33}

Some things feel cool when you touch them; other things not so much. How
do their temperatures compare when measured with a thermometer?

Equipment: Kitchen items such as aluminum pie pans, steel can openers,
Styrofoam or paper cups, and wooden salad forks are often accessible but
all have difference sizes and shapes. To simplify thinking about these
materials, also consider using four blocks of about the same size and
shape made out of aluminum, steel, Styrofoam or paper, and wood. Also
obtain a bulb and tube thermometer, digital temperature probe, or cell
phone APP that measures everyday temperatures (rather than just human
body temperatures)Â to measure the items' temperatures after you have
ranked them.

-   Rank these materials in order of temperature.
-   Explain the reasoning for your predicted ranking.

When all of your group members are ready:

-   Touch the materials. Rank them in order of temperature.
-   Explain the reasoning for your ranking.
-   Talk with your group members about your rankings and reasoning.

If you want to record some of their ideas or change yours, leave your
initial responses unchanged on the front of your paper and write instead
on the back

    their temperatures.\
    How do you as a group explain these observations based on touching
    the blocks?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Measure the temperature of all of the items with a thermometer.

There are several ways to measure the temperature of objects. One simple
way is to place a thermometer on each object in turn. One also can use a
set of objects made out of different materials with a hole drilled in
each to hold a thermometer as shown in Fig. 2.2

In using a regular glass bulb and tube thermometer, it is important to
hold on to the thermometer near the top so one's hand does not affect
the reading. Also keep holding the thermometer while waiting for the
reading to stabilize so that the thermometer does not fall over and
break.

After completing your own summary, look at an example of student work

#### *1. Example of student work about how different materials feel to the touch* {#chapter-014-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U2H42}

Many students report feeling confident that the Styrofoam feels warmest
and the metal feels coolest, based on prior experience with these
materials as well with actually touching them now. There usually are
some differences of opinion about how to rank the Styrofoam and wooden
blocks and in what order to rank the steel and aluminum metal blocks.

One student described her experience in ranking the temperature of the
four blocks after she touched them as follows:

Â 

*Four blocks were laid out in front of me. I touched all four of the
blocks and I noticed that they all felt like they were different
temperatures. The two metal blocks felt the coldest, the wood block felt
warmer than the metal blocks, and the Styrofoam block felt the warmest.
Since these different materials all felt like they were different
temperatures when I touched them, this is evidence that materials differ
in how hot or cold they feel to the touch*.

Physics Student, Spring 2016

Another student described what happened when her group used a
thermometer to measure the temperatures of the four blocks. The scale of
the thermometer was marked in degrees Celsius. This temperature scale is
named after Anders Celsius (1701-1744), a Swedish scientist who defined
a scale of a hundred degrees between the freezing and boiling points of
water. On the current Celsius scale used world-wide, the freezing point
of water is 0ÂºC, room temperature is in the neighborhood of 20ÂºC, human
body temperature is about 37ÂºC, and the boiling point of water is at
100ÂºC at standard atmospheric pressure. For a summary of the history of
measuring temperatures, see
<https://www.britannica.com/technology/thermometer#ref227799>.

The student reported the following experience:

*Students were then asked to flip over the plates and found that each
one had a small hole drilled into it. Each table was then given a
thermometer and asked to measure the temperature of the plates. Our
table measured first the wood and Styrofoam and found both to be 24
^o^C. I thought that potentially there was something wrong with my
thermometer, so I warmed it up to 30 ^o^C and then placed it into a hole
on one of the metal plates. The temperature went down and read 24 ^o^C.
I could not believe it. So I tried again with the thicker plate of metal
and once again the temperature was measured to be 24 ^o^C.*

Physics Student, Fall 2015

Most groups are surprised to find that all the materials are at about
the same temperature. The metal feels cool and the Styrofoam feels warm
but the thermometer readings for the temperature of the metals, wood and
Styrofoam are nearly or exactly the same! How can this be!

One possibility is that the thermometer is broken. That is readily
tested by holding the thermometer's bulb in one's hand. The liquid in
the thermometer's tube usually rises quickly with a warm hand on the
bulb. Another possibility is that the thermometer is working properly
and that the blocks are actually at or nearly at the same temperature.

##### ***Question 2.3 Why do some materials feel warmer or cooler than others?*** {#chapter-014-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U2H53 style="text-align: center"}

-   Talk with your group members about some possibilities for why the
    materials are all at the same temperature even though some feel
    warmer or cooler than others.
-   Share your ideas with other groups. Listen closely to ideas that
    other groups are proposing.
-   Talk with your group members about any suggestions from the other
    groups that seem helpful. Refine your group's ideas or pursue some
    new possibilities for explaining what was happening when you touched
    the different materials.
-   Share your current ideas with the other groups. Listen closely to
    ideas that other groups are proposing now.
-   Keep talking and refining ideas until your group and the other
    groups reach a consensus on some central ideas about what must be
    happening in order for the materials to have the same temperature
    but to feel so different when touched.
-   Write a summary of the central ideas based on evidence that emerged
    from the small group conversations and whole group discussions.

After completing your own summary, look at an example of student work
about thermal phenomena, nuances in exploring how hot or cold different
materials feel to the touch, and some thoughts about the nature of
science in this context.

#### *1. Example of student work about developing central ideas based on evidence* *about thermal phenomena* {#chapter-014-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U2H43}

A student interpreted the surprising finding that materials can feel
different even if at the same temperature as follows:

*...the thermometer did not read a different temperature for any of the
four plates. This made students realize that since each of the plates
was found to have the same temperature, that they were all at room
temperature. Essentially each of the plates had been left for a long
time untouched in the room and had not had a heat source or sink that
would have affected them. This means that they all were the same
temperature.*

Physics Student, Fall 2015

Usually while discussing why the blocks are all at the same temperature,
someone eventually utters the phrase *room temperature*. Occasionally
someone will use the phrase *ambient temperature*. This has a more
general meaning referring to the temperature of surroundings, sometimes
used to refer to the temperature of the air surrounding a big computer.
Once uttered, the phrase *room temperature* shifts most students from
puzzlement to acceptance of the finding that the four blocks are all at
the same temperature.

What remains is puzzlement about why the blocks feel so different even
though they are all at room temperature.

The small group reports of current thinking may range from "I have no
idea" to thoughts that hint at the next step. Someone, for example, may
say something about hands being warmer than all of the blocks and
someone else may struggle to express an idea about the materials of the
different blocks being different in some way, hinting at the idea of a
particular property of the materials that is making a difference.

Having heard these still-emerging ideas hesitatingly expressed, the
small groups may make some progress if given another opportunity to talk
with one another. Another round of reporting out may yield a
well-articulated explanation that the class as a whole then adopts. This
student, for example, continued with such an explanation:

*Students were surprised to find that all of the plates were the same
temperature, because when they placed their hands upon them, they could
feel that the plates were colder or warmer than one another. What
students came to realize is that what they were feeling was energy
transfer by conduction. Essentially the metal objects are conductors of
heat, which means that the energy from the students' hands was flowing
from their palm into the metal...which left our hand feeling colder as
the energy was leaving.*

*In this experiment, the students found that metal was a conductor,
meaning that the metal transfers energy more quickly and has a high
thermal conductivity. However, the Styrofoam, a substance often used for
coolers, is an insulator, meaning that it has a low thermal
conductivity, meaning that it transfers energy more slowly so it can
keep hot things hot and cold things cold.*

Physics Student, Fall 2015

The rounds of conversations that result in such a clear statement of
what is happening take time, but they seem to help students make sense
of what may have been a very puzzling experience. A goal of this course
is to raise issues but to have students resolve these issues through
small group conversations and whole group discussions. The intent is to
create opportunities for students to experience science in ways similar
to the ways that scientists experience science, as both interesting and
comprehensible.

#### *2. Nuances in exploring how hot or cold different materials feel to the touch* {#chapter-014-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U2H44}

Students who held the bulb of their thermometer in their hands noted
that the temperature indicated by the thermometer was higher than the
temperature that the thermometer indicated for the four materials. They
observed that there was a *temperature difference* between their hands
and the blocks and inferred that *energy flowed from their hotter hands
into the metal blocks*, which lowered the temperature of their hands.

The inference that energy flows only from hot to cold can be hard to
accept because prior experiences may suggest a different direction. When
one is sitting on a metal bleacher at a late fall soccer game, for
example, the perception likely is that cold is seeping into one's body.
However, the inference here is that what is actually happening is that
one's body heat is flowing out into that entire metal bleacher!

The metal blocks felt cold; the Styrofoam felt warm. The inference is
that the metal blocks differed from the Styrofoam in the *property ofhow
easily the metal blocks conducted energy away from the students' hands,*
the property of *thermal conductivity*.

The inference is that more energy flowed out of the students' hands into
the metal blocks than into the Styrofoam block. The energy flowing into
the metal blocks spread rapidly throughout the blocks; the metal blocks
had a higher thermal conductivity. The students' hands lost more energy
to the metal blocks and therefore felt cold when touching the metal
blocks.

Another inference is that the energy flowing into the Styrofoam blocks
did not spread throughout the Styrofoam blocks but stayed near where the
hands were touching the blocks. The students' hands lost very little
energy to the Styrofoam blocks and therefore their hands continued to
feel warm

This introduces central ideas about the *transfer of energy* from hot to
cold objects and the ease with which such energy transfer occurs. The
inference is that energy flows quickly through materials that are
*conductors*, which have a high *thermal conductivity; e*nergy flows
slowly through materials that are *insulators*, which have low thermal
conductivities.

Note that both judgments about the four blocks were based on evidence.
Students produced rankings that differed based on observations made by
touching the blocks.Â  Students produced rankings that were the same
based on observations made with a thermometer.

The usefulness of the rankings would depend upon the purpose. If one is
choosing a material on which to sit on a cold day, rankings in terms of
*thermal conductivities* would be helpful. If one is interested in the
temperature of a room (without a heat source or sink), one could choose
to use a thermometer to measure the temperature of an object made with
any of these materials, the number obtained would be the same, or close
to the same, for all. Â (Holding the object for a long time while making
the measurement might change its temperature if the object has a high
thermal conductivity.)

#### *3. Some thoughts about the nature of science in this context* {#chapter-014-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U2H45}

Science involves making judgments based on evidence. One needs to be
aware, however, both of the nature of the evidence and its
appropriateness for answering a question. When puzzlements occur, one
may need to clarify ambiguities in formulating the question as well as
in designing an exploration. Asking *How would you rank different
materials in order of temperature?Â *turns out not be answerable by
ranking materials by how they feel to the touch. Underlying the mismatch
of that question with the suggested procedure is a conceptual
distinction between heat and temperature.

### **B. Clarifying distinctions between closely related ideas** {#chapter-014-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U2H34}

If something seems puzzling, one way to seek a better understanding is
to ponder ideas that seem closely related, are they the same or
different?

##### ***Question 2.4 What is the difference between the concepts of heat and temperature?*** {#chapter-014-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence.html#U2H54 style="text-align: center"}

A useful way to organize outcomes is to review the set up, evidence, and
relevant vocabulary for central ideas that emerge from explorations and
discussions, as in Table II.1

-   Clarify for yourself the difference in the meaning of the words
    *heat* and *temperature* in the context of physics by completing the
    following table:
    -   Make a sketch of the set up with the four different materials
    -   Note the evidence of how the materials felt when touched and
        what their temperatures were as measured by a thermometer
    -   Define any relevant vocabulary.
    -   Then write a summary of the central ideas about thermal
        phenomena developed so far in this unit.

FIG. 2.3 Student's entries describing the initial exploration of thermal
phenomena.
:::
:::

For "sketch of the set up" in the first row, this student drew the four
blocks in order from *"feels coolest"* on the left to *"feels warmest"*
on the right and labeled the blocks *"light metal, dark metal, wood,
Styrofoam*." For evidence, the student wrote "*I touched the four plates
and they physically felt different.*"

In the second row, the student drew four blocks with four thermometers
and wrote "*We put the thermometer in a hole in each plate and found
their temperatures*."

In the third row, the student drew the four blocks and two wall clocks
showing the times of 1 and 2 o'clock.Â  The student wrote, "*The
materials have been sitting out for an hour and they are the same
temperature.*"

In the fourth row, the student drew a picture of a block and hand, with
a representation of energy flowing out of three of the fingers of the
hand into the block. The student wrote, "*The plate felt cold because
the energy left my hand and went into the plate*."

In the fifth row, the student drew a picture of two blocks, each with a
hand touching the block. The hand touching the metal block has a
representation of energy flowing out of four fingers; the hand touching
the Styrofoam block has a representation of energy flowing out of only
one finger. The student wrote, "*The metal felt colder than the
Styrofoam because it conducts energy better*."

In the sixth row, the student drew a picture of a thermometer and
labeled it "*temperature*" and a picture of a block with a hand on it
and labeled "*heat*".Â  The student wrote : "*The temperature is a number
measured by a thermometer and heat is the energy that is flowing or not
flowing from us into the metal*."

The student wrote the following rationales for the central ideas claimed
in the third column of the table:

Â 

***Materials differ in how hot or cold they feel to the touch*** *. Four
blocks were laid out in front of me. I touched all four of the blocks
and I noticed that they all felt like they were different temperatures.
The two metal blocks felt the coldest, the wood block felt warmer than
the metal blocks, and the Styrofoam block felt the warmest. Since these
different materials all felt like they were different temperatures when
I touched them, this is evidence that materials differ in how hot or
cold they feel to the touch.*

***Temperature is measured by a thermometer.*** *The thermometer that we
used to measure the temperatures of the four blocks was long and narrow
and had rounded edges. The thermometer was made out of glass and it
measured the temperatures in degrees Celsius.*

***Materials left for a long time without a heat source or sink in the
room come to the same temperature, room temperature*** *. The four
blocks of different materials were laid out for a long time without
being touched at all. There were no heat sources or sinks in the room.
This allowed the blocks time to sit in room temperature.*

*Each of the four blocks had a small hole in it that allowed the
thermometer to sit inside of the material. To measure the temperature of
each of the blocks, I held the thermometer in the hole for a minute by
holding it at the top so that my hand did not affect the temperature.
After waiting for a minute for the thermometer to finish reading the
temperature of the material, I recorded the temperature of each of the
blocks.*

*The light-colored metal block was 18Â°C, the dark-colored metal block
was 18.25-18.5Â°C, the wood block was 18.5-18.75Â°C, and the Styrofoam was
19Â°C. Even though the blocks differed in how hot or cold they felt to
the touch, the readings are all within 1Â°C of each other. Because the
readings on a thermometer for the four blocks of different materials
were all relatively the same temperature, room temperature, this is
evidence that materials left for a long time without a heat source or
sink in the room come to the same temperature, room temperature.*

***A temperature difference implies energy is flowing from hot objects
to colder objects.*** *Four blocks that are room temperature were laid
out in front of me. We know that the blocks are room temperature because
they were left for a long time without any heat source or sink in the
room.*

*When students touched the blocks, they noticed that some felt colder or
warmer than others. Human body temperature is warmer than room
temperature, so my hand is warmer than the blocks. When I touched the
metal block it felt cold. There is a difference in temperature between
my hand and the metal block, which is what allowed energy to flow from
the warmer object, my hand, to the colder object, the metal block.
Energy leaving from my hand to the metal block made my hand feel cold.
Metal has high thermal conductivity, so energy is quickly transferred
from my hand and I feel the temperature difference right away.*

*The wood and the Styrofoam are insulators, so they have lower thermal
conductivity. Because the transfer of energy takes longer for these
materials, there is less energy flowing, and as a result my hand does
not feel as much of a temperature difference.*

*Energy transfer by conduction, in this context, refers to the rate that
energy is transferred by touch between two objects, such as a hand and a
metal block. Energy is transferring from my hand to the blocks, because
they are different temperatures. My body temperature is warmer than the
metal block and when I touch the metal block my hand feels cold, which
is evidence that a temperature difference implies energy is flowing from
hot objects to colder objects.*

***Materials differ in their thermal properties such as how well they
conduct energy*** ***throughout the material**. Thermal conductivity is
referring to the rate or speed that energy is transferring between two
objects when they touch. First of all, metal is a conductor. When I felt
the metal, it felt the coldest out of the four blocks. Since the metal
has high thermal conductivity, it rapidly transfers energy. So, when I
touch the metal, energy leaves my hand quickly, so there is a lot of
energy flowing, therefore leaving me to feel a big temperature
difference between the object and my hand.*

*Next, the wood and the Styrofoam are insulators. The wood and the
Styrofoam have low thermal conductivity, so they slowly transfer energy.
Styrofoam transfers energy slowly so that it can keep hot things hot and
cold things cold, which is why it is often used for coolers. Since it
takes a while for all of the energy to transfer from my hand to those
materials, there is less energy flowing and I feel less of a temperature
difference between the object and my hand.*

*So, because metal which is a conductor and wood and Styrofoam which are
insulators feel like they are different temperatures to the touch, this
tells us that they conduct energy at different rates. This difference in
rates for conducting energy is evidence that materials differ in their
thermal properties such as how well they conduct energy throughout the
material.*

***Heat and temperature are different ideas.*** *...Temperature is a
number measured in degrees. In class we used a thermometer to measure
the temperature of the different blocks. According to the thermometer,
the temperature of the light- colored metal block was 18Â°C, the dark
colored metal block was 18.25-18.5Â°C, the wood block was 18.5-18.75Â°C,
and the Styrofoam was 19Â°C. So, the numbers measured by the thermometer
were the temperatures of the blocks.*

*Heat can be thought of as a feeling, for instance the metal blocks felt
colder than the other blocks, however what the students are feeling is
the transfer of energy. Heat is the energy that is flowing or not
flowing from us into the metal. So, when I touched the metal with my
hand, the energy from my hand rapidly transferred to the metal because
it is a conductor. The heat is what one feels because of the transfer of
energy from one thing to another. Less energy was flowing from my hand
to the wood, and even less to the Styrofoam, because they are insulators
and are slower at conducting energy.*

*Because the different materials felt like they were different
temperatures, the rate of the energy flow of each of the materials is
different. Even though the rate of the energy flow of each material is
different, the temperatures on the thermometer are all within 1Â°C of
each other. So, since the thermal conductivity of the materials are
different while the temperatures of the materials are about the same;
this is evidence that heat and temperature are different ideas.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

This student recognized that even though the measured temperatures were
in the expected direction, with the Styrofoam block's temperature
slightly higher than the light-colored metal block's temperature, a
measured difference within 1Â°C could not explain the very large
difference felt when touching these materials. The inference is that the
large difference in how these materials felt to the touch was due to a
large difference in a property of the materials, in how well they
conducted energy from warm hands, their *thermal conductivities*.

Styrofoam is an insulator; it has a low thermal conductivity. Energy
flowing from a warm hand to the Styrofoam stayed where the hand was
touching the Styrofoam; therefore, energy stopped flowing from the hand
to the Styrofoam when the hand and the small place where the hand was
touching the Styrofoam became the same warm temperature. The rest of the
Styrofoam remained near room temperature.

The metals, however, are conductors; they have high thermal
conductivities. Energy flowing from a hand to the metal continued
flowing and spreading throughout the metal block. Energy continued to
flow from the hand, noticeably cooling the hand so the metal felt cool.

#### *1. Example of student work explaining an intriguing thermal phenomenon* {#chapter-015-using-powerful-ideas-about-thermal-phenomena-to-explain-an-intriguing-phenomenon.html#U2H47}

After discussing the difference between heat and temperature, a student
wrote:

*The ideas above can help explain why metal parts of a chair feel colder
than the plastic seat even though both parts of the chair have been in
the same room for the same amount of time. One important idea to
remember is that the metal part and the plastic part are the same
temperature, regardless of how they feel. The metal part of the chair is
a conductor so the heat from our bodies transfers quickly to the metal,
leaving our hand feeling cold. However, plastic is not as conductive;
the heat from our bodies takes longer to transfer to the plastic so our
hand feels warmer.*

*I invited my friend to explore thermal phenomena with me. I engaged my
friend in thinking about the difference between heat and temperature by
adapting the activity we did in class with materials that I had in my
house. I provided her with a metal spatula, a wooden spoon, and a
Styrofoam coffee cup. I asked her to feel each of the objects and rank
these materials by temperature and to roughly estimate what the
temperature of each object was. She, like many of us in class, gave a
clear ranking and suggested that the temperatures of each object were
dramatically different.*

*I then explained, because I did not have a thermometer to prove it,
that each of the materials was the same temperature. She looked at me
puzzled and bluntly asked why they felt so obviously different. I
explained to her, like it is stated above, that the materials act as
conductors, some better than others, and that the rate the heat is
transferred determines how it feels to us.*

*She then told me that she had learned about this before, but it had not
stuck with her. So hopefully this will.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

This is a typical report, that the friend or family member ranks the
items by how hot or cold the items feel, expresses surprise when shown
or told that the items are at the same temperature, recognizes the
explanation that all are at room temperature but differ in how well they
conduct energy throughout the material, and notes a lack of retaining
learning that had occurred earlier.

There are many ways to explore thermal phenomena. Thermometers are
useful tools and come in many forms, based upon many different physical
processes that depend upon how some change occurs with a change in
temperature. This course uses digital temperature probes. Students can
use regular bulb and tube thermometers that measure everyday
temperatures (rather than only warm body temperatures), however, such as
those that are typically available in schools.

### **A. Exploring thermal phenomena with technology** {#chapter-016-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-about-thermal-phenomena.html#U2H36}

Students can see visually what is happening moment-by-moment on a graph
of temperature versus time when usingÂ digital temperature probes
connected to a computer. Students also can use regular bulb and tube
thermometers in the explorations that begin with Question 2.7 below.
Students using regular thermometers can become aware of what is
happening moment-by-moment by viewing the figures below.

Â 

Equipment for each group:\
â¢ Provide two digital temperature probes that can be connected to a
computer loaded with the relevant software, two regular bulb and tube
thermometers and a stop watch, or a cell phone temperature app. Â Several
technology companies such as pasco.com and vernier.com provide digital
temperature probes. For example, we use Go!Temp probes Â (see
[https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/temperature-sensors/go-temp/](https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/temperature-sensors/go-temp)
) that connect to a computer or other electronic device through free
software, such as Logger Lite
(<http://www.vernier.com/products/software/logger-lite/#download>).\
â¢Provide a computer to use with the digital temperature probes. In our
course, usually at least one student in a group can bring a laptop on
days a computer is needed. We also have two netbooks that students can
use or two groups can work together with one computer if necessary.\
â¢ To begin explorations, provide each group with a cup of cold water to
cool the probe quickly. The students can use their hands to warm up the
probe or a cup of hot water. Place the cup(s) of water on a tray well
away from the computer.\
â¢ Also provide a towel in case of spills.

Â 

The first exploration is very open-ended, in order to help students
become familiar with using the temperature probes.

##### ***Question 2.6 What can you find out about thermal phenomena*** ***with a temperature probe connected to a computer?*** {#chapter-016-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-about-thermal-phenomena.html#U2H56 style="text-align: center"}

This initial open-ended exploration provides time to learn how to set up
the computer, download the software, plug in the temperature probe, and
*play.* You and your group members have access to yourselves as heat
sources and whatever is around you as materials.

-   What questions can you ask and answer by playing in various ways
    with a temperature probe connected to a computer? Use a physics
    notebook page to keep track of what you are asking, doing, and
    thinking.

As shown in Fig. 2.4, the computer will be plotting a graph of
temperature in degrees Celsius versus time in seconds. To start the
computer program using Go Temp! probes, click on the little green box
near the middle of the top of the screen.

### **B. Exploring thermal phenomena with everyday materials** {#chapter-016-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-about-thermal-phenomena.html#U2H37}

One activity most children enjoy at home, at school, and at the beach is
playing with water.Â  Explorations that involve mixing hot and cold water
can be a logistic challenge but provide an engaging context for
additional explorations of thermal phenomena.

Â 

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;padding: 5px 5px"}
For a series of explorations in mixing hot and cold water, use for each
group of students:

-   two temperature probes (or regular thermometers)
-   clear plastic cup with lines indicating 1, 2, 3, or 4 parts for
    measuring (or a set of measuring cups),
-   large Styrofoam cup or ceramic coffee mug for hot water,
-   clear plastic cup for cold water,
-   quart Styrofoam or plastic containers for storing hot and cold
    water,
-   large container for storing water when finished with a trial
-   tray large enough for holding the cups involved in mixing hot and
    cold water,
-   towels in case things spill.

Place the tray and containers of water on a separate area or table from
the computer to protect the computer in case of spills.

##### ***Question 2.7 What happens when you mix various amounts of hot and cold water?*** {#chapter-016-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-about-thermal-phenomena.html#U2H57 style="text-align: center"}

-   Explore thermal phenomena more systematically by mixing hot and cold
    water. In the *Before* section of a new physics notebook page sketch
    predictions for graphs that will appear on the computer screen when
    you mix hot and cold water in the following ways:

a: Equal amounts at same temperature

b: Equal amounts at unequal temperatures

c: Unequal amounts at same temperature

d: Unequal amounts at unequal temperatures: more hot than cold

e: more cold than hot

-   Discuss and agree on the details of how you will be doing the
    mixing:
    -   What type of cup will you use for the hot water. Why?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   -   Will you pour the cold water into the hot water or pour the hot
        water into the cold? Why?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   -   How will you measure how much hot and cold water you are using?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Place one temperature probe in the hot water; the other in the cold
    water.\
    Click on the green box at the top of the computer screen to start
    the program.

As you pour the cold water into the hot water, also transfer its
temperature probe so that both temperature probes are now in the mixture
of hot and cold water.\
If you are using bulb and tube thermometers, place one in the hot water
and one in the cold water. Record both temperatures. Also record the
temperature of the mixture of hot and cold water.

-   In the *During* section of your physics notebook page, record the
    graphs obtained by mixing the various amounts of hot and cold water
    specified above.
-   Also record and define any new vocabulary relevant to this
    exploration.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Discuss with your group members how to describe these graphs in
    words.\
    What central ideas about mixing hot and cold water can you generate
    from this exploration?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   In the *After* section of your physics notebook page, state central
    ideas that have emerged from this exploration and the evidence on
    which they are based.
-   State a rationale that explains how the evidence supports these
    ideas and why these are important.
-   Add a reflection about what you want to remember about this
    exploration, how you might use this in your own classroom, what you
    learned about science learning and teaching...
-   What are you still wondering?

A useful way to organize outcomes is to record the set up, evidence, and
relevant vocabulary for central ideas that emerge from explorations and
discussions, as in the continuation of Table II.1.

(continued)

-   Complete the continuation of Table II.1 and write a summary of what
    you learned from this exploration.

After completing Table II.1 and your summary, look at an example of
student work, nuances about exploring thermal phenomena by mixing hot
and cold water, and some thoughts about the nature of science in this
context.

#### *1. Example of student work about mixing hot and cold water* {#chapter-016-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-about-thermal-phenomena.html#U2H48}

A student summarized the exploration involving mixing hot and cold water
as follows:

*(The table) shows the experiments that we conducted in order to answer
our questions and it also displays the ideas that were developed based
upon these experiments.*

FIG. 2.7 Student's entries describing the mixing of hot and cold water
exploration.
:::

For the sketch of the set up in the first row, this student drew two
containers representing cups of water and labeled them "*2 hot*" and "*2
hot* ."Â  The student wrote, "*I mixed 2 parts hot water with 2 parts hot
water and the temperature didn't change*."

In the second row, the student drew two containers and labeled them "*2
hot*" and "*1 hot*." The student wrote, "*I mixed 2 parts hot water with
1 part hot water and the temperature didn't change*."

In the third row, the student drew two containers and labeled them "*2
hot"* and "*2 cold."* The student wrote, "*I mixed 2 parts hot water
with 2 parts cold water and the temperature was in the middle of their
initial temperatures."*

In the fourth row, the student drew two containers and labeled them "*2
cold"* and *"1 hot."* The student wrote, "*I mixed 2 parts cold water
with 1 part hot water and the temperature was closer to the initial
temperature of the cold water*."

The student wrote the following rationales for the ideas claimed in the
third column of the table:

***When mixing two amounts of water at the same temperature, the
equilibrium temperature of the mixture is the same as the initial
temperature, whether the amounts are equal or unequal.*** *(Figure 2.8)
shows the graphs for mixing equal and unequal amounts of water at the
same temperature. The first graph shows mixing equal amounts of water at
the same temperature. I mixed 2 parts hot water with 2 parts hot water
and the temperature of the water did not change from the initial
temperature of the hot water. The second graph shows mixing unequal
amounts of water at the same temperature. I mixed 2 parts hot water with
1part hot water and the temperature of the water did not change from the
initial temperature of the hot water. The graphs in (Figure 2.8) are
evidence for the idea that when mixing two amounts of water at the same
temperature, the equilibrium temperature of the mixture is the same as
the initial temperature, whether the amounts are equal or unequal.*

Physics Student, Spring 2016

Â 

This was the first experience for these students in drawing and
interpreting temperature graphs in this course. This student was careful
to label the vertical axis with equal-distant marks representing a
temperature scale and to color code the lines representing the changing
temperatures for the two temperature probes. The student also indicated
on the horizontal axis the time in seconds that the mixing took place.

#### *2. Nuances about exploring thermal phenomena by mixing hot and cold water* {#chapter-016-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-about-thermal-phenomena.html#U2H49}

Adults are unlikely to have difficulty understanding that mixing equal
or unequal amounts of water at the same temperature will result in a
mixture at that same temperature. These scenarios are included here
because this does not necessarily seem obvious to children. They may be
so accustomed to adding numbers that they may predict that they need to
add the two temperatures if they are adding the two amounts of water
together. The flat line on the resulting graph also is helpful even for
adult students in that it makes clear that such a flat line represents
something that is not changing, in this case the temperature of the
water.

Mixing equal amounts of hot and cold water can be problematic. One needs
to take care in measuring the equal amounts.Â  With small amounts, such
as a half of cup each, small errors in measuring can bias the result.
The expectation is that the final temperature, called the **equilibrium
temperature,** will be half way between the two initial temperatures
when mixing equal amounts at unequal temperatures.

In Fig. 2.12, does it look like the hot water changed temperature a
little more than the cold? Why might that have happened?

Â

It may be that there were not exactly equal amounts of hot and cold
water. Another possibility is that the amounts were equal but the hot
water was poured into the cold water so some of the energy in the hot
water flowed into the air and container as well as into the cold water.
This would reduce the energy transferred to the cold water and look like
a slightly smaller amount of hot water was used.

Figure 2.13 and Fig. 2.14 show the result of mixing different amounts of
hot and cold water at different temperatures.

-   In each of these experiments, which had the bigger temperature
    change? Which the smaller temperature change?
-   In each of these experiments, which do you think was the bigger
    amount of water? The hot or the cold water?

FIG. 2.13 Mixing unequal amounts of water at unequal temperatures.

:::
:::

In Fig. 2.13, it looks like the change in temperature of the hot water
was smaller than the change in temperature of the cold water. Â Consider
a bathtub with very hot water, much too hot for a bath. What to do? Add
some cold water to cool things down, but not too much! If you mix a
little cold water with a lot of hot water, which will change temperature
the most?

The temperature of this small amount of cold water will change a lot as
it mixes in with a large mass of hot water. The change in temperature is
smaller for the larger mass of hot water. The change in temperature is
larger for the smaller mass of cold water. Therefore, there must have
been more hot water than cold in this scenario.

Figure 2.14 also shows the result of mixing different amounts of hot and
cold water. Which had the bigger temperature change here? Which had the
smaller temperature change?Â  Which do you think was the bigger amount of
water?Â  The hot or the cold water?

In Fig. 2.14 the hot water had the bigger temperature change and the
cold water had the smaller change in temperature. In this scenario,
there must have been more cold than hot because the equilibrium
temperature was nearer to the initial cold temperature.

A goal of this course is to build skills in interpreting line graphs in
this way, to be able to "tell the story" of what happened by looking at
the shapes of the lines and interpreting what must have happened in
order for the lines to have formed in that way.

In Figs. 2.12 -- 2.14, for example, the horizontal axis is representing
the increase in time from left to right. The vertical axis is
representing the temperature of the temperature probes.

-   What does the red line at the beginning of the experiment indicate
    was happening to the temperature probe for the hot water?
-   What does the blue line at the beginning of the experiment indicate
    was happening to the temperature probe for the cold water?
-   What does the overlapping of the red and blue lines near the end of
    the mixing process indicate about what happened when these cups of
    hot and cold water were mixed together?

The almost flat red line at the beginning of the experiment suggests
that the temperature of the hot water was not changing much as the
temperature probe was sitting in the cup of hot water. There is a slight
slant downward of the red line indicating that the hot water was cooling
slightly in its cup. Then there is a very sharp change in the hot
temperature recorded by this probe; the red line plunges almost
instantly to a much lower temperature, suggesting that the sharp bend
occurred the moment that the cold water was poured into the cup of hot
water.

The straight blue line near the beginning of the experiment suggests
that the temperature probe for the cold water was initially not in the
cup of cold water but was outside of the cup, perhaps at room
temperature when the computer program was started. The curved blue line
represents the drop in temperature when the probe was then placed in the
cup of cold water.

In Fig. 2.12 and Fig. 2.13, the temperature probe for the cold water was
in the cold water long enough that the blue line has almost flattened
out, indicating that the probe was near to reading the temperature of
the cold water before mixing began. In Fig. 2.14, the blue line becomes
almost flat. It is important to stir both cups of water and to wait
until both lines are flat before pouring the cold water into the hot
water. Record both temperatures just before mixing, in order to be sure
that the initial readings of the temperatures of the hot and cold water
are accurate.

The overlapping lines for both temperature probes at the end of the
mixing process indicate that the two temperature probes were reading the
same temperature, the *equilibrium temperature* reached after the mixing
was complete. This assumes that the probes had been *calibrated,* that
they had indicated the same temperature when placed in the same cup of
water at the beginning of the experiment. If the two probes did not
indicate the same temperature when placed in the same cup of water at
the beginning of the experiment, the computer program needed to be
instructed to change the calibration so that the readings of the two
probes would agree when reading the same temperature.

Note how quickly the temperatures change as the mixing begins. Also note
the shape of the curves as the temperatures change more gradually as the
mixture comes to equilibrium. When drawing graphs, also take care to
match the time when the lines start changing drastically, as temperature
readings by both the hot and cold probes will start changing at the same
instant, at the moment that the cold water is poured into the hot.

Figuring out how best to measure and mix the hot and cold water in order
to maximize the accuracy of results is an example of anÂ *engineering
designÂ *problem. The possible effects of pouring hot water into cold
versus pouring cold water into hot, of stirring or not stirring before
and after mixing, of calibrating the thermometers, and of timing the
recording of initial conditions are all issues that need to be
identified with solutions developed and optimized. (See Appendix
I,Â *Engineering Design in the Next Generation Science Standards,

#### *3. Some thoughts about the nature of science in this context* {#chapter-016-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-about-thermal-phenomena.html#U2H410}

An important aspect of doing science is being able to represent and
interpret changes that are occurring. Visual displays such as graphs can
make aspects visible that might otherwise go unnoticed. Figures 2.13 and
2.14, for example, show dramatic differences in the stability of the
initial temperatures of the hot and cold temperature probes. Â The
initial almost flat line for the hot probe indicates a stable initial
condition but the initial curved line for the cold probe indicates a
dramatically changing initial condition. Such differences could affect
the results. It is important in doing careful experiments that both the
hot and cold temperature probes show a flat line, indicating a stable
initial temperature, before mixing occurs.

These graphs show how the hot and cold water temperatures changed with
time; such line graphs show how one quantity, represented by the
vertical axis, changes with another quantity, represented by the
horizontal axis. Learning to "tell the story" of such line graphs is an
important skill in many fields. Being able to interpret such visual
displays of data can enhance one's ability to influence and/or evaluate
claims being made, whether in science, business, or personal contexts.

The use of digital temperature probes in this unit illustrate the
affordances provided by technologies in collecting and interpreting
data. As indicated in the USÂ *Next Generation Science
Standards*,Â *scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence.* Third
to fifth grade students, for example, should understand thatÂ *scientists
useÂ tools and technologies to make accurate measurements and
observationsÂ (NGSS, Lead States, 2013, Appendix H).* (See:
<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices>.)

Being able to tell a story about what is happening by looking at a graph
is a useful skill whenever one is monitoring a numerical quantity.
Graphs can show at a glance how something is changing, whether that
involves finances, populations, sales, or some other quantity of
interest. Being able to relate quantities algebraically also is helpful
if one wants to make numerical predictions based on evidence rather than
intuition. This section builds on skills in interpreting qualitative
line graphs, such as those shown in Figs. 2.12-2.14. You also will
develop quantitative skills for generating and justifying relevant
equations, solving for an unknown, and calculating a quantity of
interest.

### **A. Interpreting features of line graphs** {#chapter-017-developing-an-additional-powerful-idea-about-thermal-phenomena-and-its-mathematical-representations.html#U2H38}

"Telling the story" represented by a line graph involves looking at the
shape of the graph and interpreting its features.

##### ***Question 2.8 How can you tell what is happening by interpreting the shape of a line graph?*** {#chapter-017-developing-an-additional-powerful-idea-about-thermal-phenomena-and-its-mathematical-representations.html#U2H58 style="text-align: center"}

Look at the shapes of the lines in the graphs shown in Figs. 2.15 and
2.16. What was happening if these graphs are representing the mixing of
hot and cold water? Which of these graphs is intended to represent
mixing more hot water than cold?Â  Which is intended to represent mixing
more cold water than hot?

For these graphs, an important feature is the [length of the
line]{style="text-decoration: underline"} representing the changing
temperature of the hot water as compared to the length of the line
representing the changing temperature of the cold water.

FIG. 2.16 Graph representing the mixing of hot and cold water. More hot
water or more cold water?
:::
:::

Note that in Fig. 2.15, the student drew a long vertical dashed line to
represent the time when the mixing of hot and cold water started, shown
by the pink line bending down and the green line bending up. The initial
bends are not as steep as shown in Fig. 2.13 but the lines start bending
roughly at the same time, represented by the vertical line. The long
vertical dashed line matches where both of the lines representing the
hot- and cold-water temperatures started changing direction,
representing that the temperatures of both the hot and cold water
started changing at the same moment.Â The short vertical dashed line
indicates roughly the time when the temperatures of the hot and cold
water stopped changing as well, shown by the pink and green lines
leveling off at about the same height above the horizontal axis, with
that height representing the equilibrium temperature. Â The student wrote
"*reach equilibrium"* to label what was happening there. The equilibrium
is closer to the initial hot temperature, indicating that this was a
case of more hot water mixing with cold.

In Fig. 2.16, however, the student did not match the lines representing
times when the hot and cold water started changing direction. This graph
suggests a story in which the cold water started warming up first and
almost reached the equilibrium temperature before the hot water started
cooling off. This is different from the story told by the lines in Fig.
2.14. It is important when drawing line graphs to check the story that
your lines are telling. Are the details of your lines accurately telling
the story of what is happening? The equilibrium temperature is closer to
the initial cold temperature, indicating that this was a case of more
cold water mixing with hot.

### **B. Identifying patterns in data** {#chapter-017-developing-an-additional-powerful-idea-about-thermal-phenomena-and-its-mathematical-representations.html#U2H39}

General thinking about a situation can help you decide how to set up a
series of experiments to collect enough data to be able to perceive a
pattern in the data. Once you have identified a pattern, try to
represent that pattern mathematically. If the pattern can be expressed
by an algebraic equation, you can use that the relationship to make
predictions or to estimate a quantity of interest. That process is the
focus of this section.

#### *1. Designing a series of experiments to identify patterns in data* {#chapter-017-developing-an-additional-powerful-idea-about-thermal-phenomena-and-its-mathematical-representations.html#U2H411}

##### ***Â Question 2.9 When mixing hot and cold water, how are the amounts of hot and cold water related to how much their temperatures change?*** {#chapter-017-developing-an-additional-powerful-idea-about-thermal-phenomena-and-its-mathematical-representations.html#U2H59 style="text-align: center"}

-   To explore what happens quantitatively when you mix various amounts
    of hot and cold water, first decide what data to record and how you
    want to keep track of these data.
    -   
    -   If you want to double, triple, and quadruple an amount of water
        for a series of experiments, how might you do that?

[One way would be to use mass.Â  If you have a balance, you could measure
100 grams, 200 grams, 300 grams, or 400 grams of
water.]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}

[Another way would be to use volume. If you have a 500-milliliter
measuring cup, you could measure 100ml, 200ml, 300ml, or 400 ml of
water]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}

[Equivalently, use any container that you can mark with 1, 2, 3, 4
levels to measure multiples of the initial
amount.]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}

-   -   How will you measure the initial and final temperatures?

[Two regular bulb and tube thermometers will work fine. Using two
digital temperature probes connected to a computer, however, will allow
you to build skill in interpreting the graphs that appear as you mix the
various amounts.]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}

-   -   What combinations of hot and cold water will you try and how
        will you record your findings?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Another issue is how best to carry out your experiments: What might
    affect how much the temperatures of the hot and cold water change?
    -   [How can you be sure that you are measuring the amounts of water
        consistently with your measuring
        devise?]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}

        water?]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}

-   In the *Before* section of your physics notebook page, describe your
    experimental design -- how you plan to conduct these experiments.
    This also is a place to record your initial thoughts about what to
    do with your data once obtained and to make predictions for the
    results.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Explain your reasoning for the process you will use to make these
    predictions.

This process of designing your exploration by deciding on what to do,
what data to record, how to use these data, and predicting what you
expect to occur is an important aspect of learning to do science. This
open-ended process contrasts with one in which a laboratory manual or
teacher already has made most of those decisions for you. The intent
here is to model the experimental process as well as the conceptual
process of developing central ideas and the mathematical process of
representing what is happening through graphs and algebraic equations.

-   In the *During* section of your notebook page, create a table to
    record the findings for each experiment in a clear way.
-   Also note any new words or familiar vocabulary that you have noticed
    as having special meanings in this context.
-   Discuss your findings and formulate a relevant central idea.
-   Sometimes one feels overwhelmed in the midst of an exploration,
    particularly if one is trying to figure out relationships among
    variables rather than simply following a lab manual's verification
    recipe. If that happens, it can be helpful to ask:
    -   What are we doing?
    -   Why are we doing this?
    -   How is that helping us?

Â 

-   In the ***After*** section of the physics notebook page, report this
    central idea and the evidence on which it is based.
-   Write a rationale that explains how the evidence supports the
    central idea and why this is important.
-   Also reflect upon this exploration such as what connections can you
    make to other experiences? How might you use what you learned in
    your own classroom?
-   What are you still wondering?

After class, write a summary based on your physics notebook pages and
handouts before reviewing the following discussion of comparing ratios
of hot and cold water and their changes in temperature. To maximize
learning, it is important to work through issues in conversation with
your group members and with guidance as needed from your instructor in
class before reading this text. The purpose of the sections below is to
help clarify any details that may be puzzling.

#### *2. Recording and analyzing data* {#chapter-017-developing-an-additional-powerful-idea-about-thermal-phenomena-and-its-mathematical-representations.html#U2H412}

There are many ways to record and analyze data. As an example, consider
Fig. 2.14, repeated from above, for an experiment in which two parts of
cold water were mixed with one part of hot water.

The vertical axis represents temperature in degrees Celsius; the
horizontal axis represents time in seconds. The computer display
indicates that the mixture of the hot and cold water reached an
equilibrium temperature of 19.0 ÂºC. The precision of the digital
thermometers is nice but not necessary. If we had been using regular
thermometers rather than digital thermometers, probably both regular
thermometers would have indicated an equilibrium temperature of about
19ÂºC. That level of precision would be enough for the purposes of this
experiment. The graph on the computer is useful, however, in providing
an informative visual display of what is happening.

Looking at the initial red line, which is just below the 40ÂºC grid line,
what is an estimate of the initial temperature of the hot water?

Looking at the lowest point of the initial blue line, which is just
below the 10ÂºC grid line, what is an estimate of the initial temperature
of the cold water?

The ratio of parts of cold water to hot water is 2/1. The final
temperature of the hot water was about 19ÂºC; the initial temperature of
the hot water was about 39ÂºC. The final temperature of the cold water
was about 19ÂºC; the initial temperature of the cold water was about 9ÂºC.
Â Although the digital temperature probes provide more precise readings,
we are choosing to record readings at Â± 1ÂºC here to ease visual
inspection of the calculations in Table II.2.

A table would be helpful in recording and analyzing such data.

  : Table II.2 Reporting data and analyzing experiments mixing hot and
  cold water

A similar table can be made for other combinations, such as mixing 1
part hot water with 4 parts cold, 2 parts hot water with 1 part cold, or
4 parts hot water with 1 part cold. Assembling such data for multiple
experiments makes possible looking for patterns in the data across
multiple contexts.

Â 

For the experiment represented in Fig. 2.14, what are the changes in
temperature for the hot and cold water? When describing changes in
temperature in everyday life, we usually indicate whether the
temperature increases or decreases: "it will be 5 degrees *warmer* today
than yesterday," "the cake *cooled* to room temperature," or "her
temperature is *back down* to normal." Mathematically, we describe
whether a temperature change is hotter or colder with a positive or
negative sign. Therefore, we mathematically define a change in
temperature as the final temperature T~f~Â  minus the initial temperature
T~i~ and use âT, delta T, to represent a change in temperature:

change in temperature Â =Â  âT = T~f~Â  -- T~i~

When the temperature increases, the change in temperature is positive.
When the temperature decreases, the change in temperature is negative.
When mixing hot and cold water, the final temperature for both the hot
and the cold water is the equilibrium temperature T~e~ so for both
changes in temperature, subtract the initial temperature from the
equilibrium temperature:

change in temperature Â =Â  âT = T~e~Â  -- T~i~

Figure 2.17 provides a visual way to think about the relationships among
the initial, final, and equilibrium temperatures when mixing hot and
cold water.

For the hot water:

âT~h~ = T~hf~Â  -- T~hi~ Â = T~e~Â  -- T~hi~Â  = 19Â°C -- 39Â°CÂ  = Â -- 20Â°C

The minus sign indicates that âT~h~, the change in the hot water
temperature, was a decrease in temperature. All âT~h~ Â in these mixing
hot and cold water experiments will have a negative value as the hot
water will always be at a higher initial temperature than the
equilibrium temperature. Subtracting the higher initial temperature from
this lower equilibrium temperature will always yield a negative value.

For the cold water:

âT~c~ = T~cf~Â  -- T~ci~ Â = T~e~Â  -- T~ci~Â  = 19Â°CÂ  -- 9Â°CÂ Â  =Â  + 10Â°C

The plus sign indicates that âT~c~, the change in the cold water
temperature, was an increase in temperature. All âT~c~ in these mixing
hot and cold water experiments will have a positive value as the cold
water will always be at a lower initial temperature than the equilibrium
temperature. Subtracting the lower initial temperature from this higher
equilibrium temperature will always yield a positive value

It can be helpful, when working with problems involving mixing hot and
cold water, to sketch a graph that illustrates what is happening as in
Fig. 2.18.

Entering these findings in the table and highlighting these changes in
temperature and the parts of hot and cold water creates a visual display
that can help identify patterns in these data. The magnitude of the
change in temperature of the hot water would be twice as much as
magnitude of the change in temperature of the cold water.

Calculating the change in temperatures of the hot water and the cold
water completes Table II.2:

#### *3. Interpreting findings* {#chapter-017-developing-an-additional-powerful-idea-about-thermal-phenomena-and-its-mathematical-representations.html#U2H413}

How are the highlighted quantities in Table II.2 related mathematically?

Given that we have been comparing what happens when mixing various
ratios of the amounts of hot and cold water, it seems reasonable to
compare the changes in temperatures as ratios as well:

![\\frac{\\text{Part hot}}{\\text{Part
cold}}](OEBPS/assets/fe8b6c7d332280a994265fc8e5eb5fe1.png "\frac{\text{Part hot}}{\text{Part cold}}"){.latex
.mathjax} Â equals: Â  Â  ![\\frac{\\text{Change in temperature

The results of this experiment indicate that the [**ratio** of the
amount of hot water to the amount of cold
water]{style="text-decoration: underline"}Â (1 to 2) seems to be related
to the [**inverse ratio** of the change in cold temperature to the
change in hot temperature]{style="text-decoration: underline"}.

There is a problem, however, in that the ratio of the temperatures is
negative but the magnitudes match; they are both of magnitude 1/2. The
magnitude of a quantity is its numerical value without reference to
whether the value is positive or negative.

Sometimes students also are puzzled by what their results seem to be
saying. Most ratios that students have worked with in other contexts
seem to have been *direct proportions*, as in the pinhole camera, where
the entities are in the same order: H/D = h/d or expressed another way:
h/H = d/D, the ratio of corresponding heights in similar triangles is
equal to the ratio of corresponding distances.

This new relationship between ratios is representing an *inverse
proportion*:

![\\frac{\\text{Property 1 of Top Entity}}{\\text{Property 1 of Bottom
Entity}}](OEBPS/assets/d9ab39bec95c77ba5f0653b625a678c8.png "\frac{\text{Property 1 of Top Entity}}{\text{Property 1 of Bottom Entity}}"){.latex
.mathjax} is related to ![\\frac{\\text{Property 2 of Bottom
Entity}}{\\text{Property 2 of Top
Entity}}](OEBPS/assets/25dfda6c9b1dc4d68c7d5fcbc06a1173.png "\frac{\text{Property 2 of Bottom Entity}}{\text{Property 2 of Top Entity}}"){.latex
.mathjax}

If a result seems wrong, consider whether something has gone wrong or
whether this experimental result is what is really happening. Based on
the data presented above, the [ratio of a small amount of hot
water]{style="text-decoration: underline"} to a [large amount of cold
water]{style="text-decoration: underline"} is related to the magnitude
of the [ratio of a small change in temperature of the large amount of
cold water]{style="text-decoration: underline"} to the magnitude of a
[large change in temperature of the small amount of hot
water.]{style="text-decoration: underline"} This is a description of
what the graph showed in Fig. 2.14. In this case, the temperature of a
large amount of cold water changed a little; the temperature of a small
amount of hot water changed a lot.

In addition to considering whether a puzzling result seems logical and
in agreement with other ways to represent the data obtained in an
experiment, it is helpful to test whether the same result occurs in
other contexts. This result was based on an experiment mixing one part
hot water and two parts cold water. Would the same pattern occur with
other combinations such as two parts hot water and one part cold? What
about 4 parts hot water and 1 part cold? Â Or 1 part hot and 4 parts cold
water. Such multiple trials make possible looking for patterns in data
and testing whether the relationships one infers are valid. Looking for
patterns in data is an example of aÂ *crosscutting conceptÂ *that occurs
across many different science domains as discussed in Appendix G of
theÂ *Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013)
<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices> .*

4.  #### *Developing an algebraic representation of the findings*

There are several steps needed to express this relationship
appropriately in symbols. We have chosen to express the amounts of water
in terms of their masses. For the experiment shown in Fig. 2.14, the
ratio of the mass of hot water to the mass of cold water was 1 to 2:

![\\frac{\\text{ mass of hot water }}{\\text{mass of cold water}} =
\\frac{m_h}{m_c} =
\\frac{1}{2}](OEBPS/assets/c08dad8fe0c7f862427632bbab820eca.png "\frac{\text{ mass of hot water }}{\text{mass of cold water}} = \frac{m_h}{m_c} = \frac{1}{2}"){.latex
.mathjax}

which is a positive number.

The ratio of the changes in temperatures can be written as:

![\\frac{\\text{Change in temperature of the cold water}}{\\text{Change
in temperature of temperature of the hotwater}} = \\frac{\\Delta
T_c}{\\Delta T_h} = \\frac{+10\^{o}C}{-20\^{o}C} =
\\frac{-1}{2}](OEBPS/assets/2c54973a73cf8246738197c5d36bcfce.png "\frac{\text{Change in temperature of the cold water}}{\text{Change in temperature of temperature of the hotwater}} = \frac{\Delta T_c}{\Delta T_h} = \frac{+10^{o}C}{-20^{o}C} = \frac{-1}{2}"){.latex
.mathjax}

which is a negative number.

Because âT~h~ is always negative and âT~c~ is always positive, the ratio
of changes in temperature will always be a negative number. In order to
set it equal to a positive number, a minus sign needs to be added to the
expression. Therefore, the results of this experiment can be expressed
algebraically as:

![\\frac{m_h}{m_c} = \\frac{-\\Delta T_c}{\\Delta
T_h}](OEBPS/assets/49b45902b39dc8ad628a39a876604c15.png "\frac{m_h}{m_c} = \frac{-\Delta T_c}{\Delta T_h}"){.latex
.mathjax}

The results also can be expressed as

![\\frac{m_c}{m_h} = \\frac{-\\Delta T_h}{\\Delta
T_c}](OEBPS/assets/0c906e0dd11aa182f6b66040c73f2257.png "\frac{m_c}{m_h} = \frac{-\Delta T_h}{\Delta T_c}"){.latex
.mathjax}

The magnitudes of the ratios in the experiment represented by the graph
in Fig. 2.14 turned out to be exactly equal at the level of precision we
used. That is unusual in these experiments. Typically these experimental
results are only approximately equal. Therefore we choose to represent
these experimental results with the symbol â that represents
"approximately equal":

![\\frac{m_h}{m_c} \\approx\\frac{-\\Delta T_c}{\\Delta
T_h}](OEBPS/assets/8ef71e503722e20308c5b413e773850a.png "\frac{m_h}{m_c} \approx\frac{-\Delta T_c}{\Delta T_h}"){.latex
.mathjax}

and

![\\frac{m_c}{m_h} \\approx \\frac{-\\Delta T_h}{\\Delta
T_c}](OEBPS/assets/ad9d286e76577ec32d28f0e5618f0e7c.png "\frac{m_c}{m_h} \approx \frac{-\Delta T_h}{\Delta T_c}"){.latex
.mathjax}

The ratio of the mass of the hot water to the mass of the cold water is
approximately equal to minus the ratio of the change in temperature of
the cold water to the change in temperature of the hot water where
change in temperature equals the final temperature minus the initial
temperature (âT = T~f~ -T~i~).

One also can refer to the *magnitude* of the changes in temperature, the
numerical values of the changes, without reference to whether they are
an increase or decrease in temperature. The magnitude of a quantity is
represented by vertical bars on both sides of its symbol: \|âT~h~\|
represents the magnitude of the change in temperature of the hot water,
20ÂºC in this case. The ratio of the mass of hot water to the mass of
cold water is approximately equal to the ratio of the magnitude of the
change in temperature of the cold water to the magnitude of the change
in temperature of the hot water. If stated in terms of magnitudes, the
minus sign is not needed but vertical bars should be placed of both
sides of the expressions with âT symbols:

![\\frac{m_h}{m_c} \\approx\\frac{\|\\Delta T_c\|}{\|\\Delta
T_h\|}](OEBPS/assets/e222396559530be4ace1147c5b10a9cd.png "\frac{m_h}{m_c} \approx\frac{|\Delta T_c|}{|\Delta T_h|}"){.latex
.mathjax}

and

![\\frac{m_c}{m_h} \\approx \\frac{\|\\Delta T_h\|}{\|\\Delta
T_c\|}](OEBPS/assets/9332552605bb4c0674f141f321867f64.png "\frac{m_c}{m_h} \approx \frac{|\Delta T_h|}{|\Delta T_c|}"){.latex
.mathjax}

If you choose to use "magnitudes" be sure to indicate that with both the
verbal and symbolic statements of this relationship.

C.  ### **Recognizing the importance of systems thinking** {#chapter-017-developing-an-additional-powerful-idea-about-thermal-phenomena-and-its-mathematical-representations.html#U2H310}

Comparing the results for several experiments mixing various amounts of
hot and cold water can increase confidence in the interpretation
developed above, that the amounts of hot and cold water are inversely
proportional to the magnitudes of their changes in temperature. Any
differences in findings from multiple experiments would need
consideration: what are the components of the system, how might they be
interacting, how might the processes involved be affecting what is
happening?

##### ***Question 2.10 What is the role of systems thinking in interpreting experimental results?*** {#chapter-017-developing-an-additional-powerful-idea-about-thermal-phenomena-and-its-mathematical-representations.html#U2H510}

A student reported four experiments in which one set of ratios were
equal but three of the four had slightly lower changes in temperature by
the cold water than expected. The student reflected upon the role of
systems thinking in explaining these findings.

1.  #### *Example of student work reflecting upon the role of systems thinking*

*In class, we mixed varying unequal amounts of hot and cold water. Our
goal was to find a pattern in order to develop a mathematical
representation of thermal phenomena...First, I mixed 2 parts hot water
with 1 part cold water...Next, I mixed 1 part hot water with 2 parts
cold water...Next, I mixed 4 parts hot water with 1 part cold
water...Finally, I mixed 1 part hot water with 4 parts cold water...The
experimental evidence that I found is evident in all four of the
different unequal amounts of hot water and cold water that I
experimented with. These four different trials all produced
approximately equal ratios, which is experimental evidence that when
mixing unequal amounts of hot and cold water, the ratio of the amount of
hot water to the amount of cold water is approximately equal to the
ratio of the (magnitude of the) change in temperature of the cold water
to the (magnitude of the) change in temperature of the hot water..*

*Various aspects of the situation may affect how close the mathematical
model matches what actually happened. The cups of hot and cold water
form a system with energy flowing from the hot water to the cold water.
If it is a closed system, all of the energy lost by the hot water will
be gained by the cold water. If it is an open system, some of the energy
may flow out and into the environment, such as into the air or the
material of the containers. Also, if there is an energy source nearby,
some energy may flow into this system.* *Because we are trying to
understand what is happening within our system of the cups of hot and
cold water, it is important for us to keep the system as closed as
possible.*

*Because we were trying to find a pattern revolving around how the
masses of the hot and cold water related to their changes in temperature
when they were mixed, the most accurate results were found when as
little energy as possible flowed out of the hot water and into the
environment. So, the importance of system thinking in this exploration
is that in order to move from the general claim that we developed to the
precise mathematical statements, we needed to isolate the system of hot
and cold water as much as possible.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

In three of the four experiments discussed, the cold water did not
change temperature quite as much as expected. This was a consistent
effect, suggesting that the system was not a closed system consisting
only of the hot and cold water. Some of the energy from the hot water
likely flowed into the surrounding air and material forming the
containers rather than into warming the cold water. This flow of energy
into the surroundings, rather than into the cold water, would reduce the
change in temperature for the cold water.

This is an example of the development of systems thinking, that one
needs to consider all elements of a system and to observe carefully what
is occurring. According to theÂ *Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS
Lead States, 2013),* thinking aboutÂ *systems and systems models* is
common across many science disciplines as described in Appendix G --
Crosscutting Concepts
(<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices> ).

What seems remarkable is that the ratios found in these experiments can
be so close, given how simple the equipment and procedures are. We have
not asked students to take the next step of doing multiple trials of
each experiment in order to estimate uncertainties. The emphasis in this
course has been on fostering conceptual understanding of the shapes of
qualitative graphs while briefly modeling here a quantitative approach
to looking for patterns in the data. With limited time available, our
choice has been to balance this experimentally obtained insight about
the inverse relationship between the amounts of hot and cold water and
their changes in temperature with one based on theoretical
considerations.

The experimental approach discussed above focused only upon the relative
masses of the hot and cold water and their relative changes in
temperature. Â No mention was made of the energy flowing from the hot to
the cold water. An earlier section in this unit (II.B, Table II.1, page
[11](#chapter-017-developing-an-additional-powerful-idea-about-thermal-phenomena-and-its-mathematical-representations.html#T2C){.handout})
had developed the following central idea:

**A temperature difference implies a flow of energy from hotter objects
to colder objects.**

In this section, we consider how to express theoretical ways of thinking
about that transfer of energy from the hot water into the cold water.
This involves use of the Law of Conservation of Energy, that the total
energy in a closed system does not change, that energy lost by the hot
water is gained by the cold water and its surroundings.

### **A. Considering what happens when energy flows from hot water into cold** {#chapter-018-developing-a-mathematical-representation-of-thermal-phenomena-based-on-theoretical-considerations.html#U2H311}

##### ***Question 2.11 What theoretical considerations can provide insights into what is happening when energy flows from the hot water into the cold water?*** {#chapter-018-developing-a-mathematical-representation-of-thermal-phenomena-based-on-theoretical-considerations.html#U2H511}

Energy is measured in different units in different contexts. (see
<https://www.aps.org/policy/reports/popa-reports/energy/units.cfm> . In
this course, we use the energy unit of a *calorie*.

**A calorie is the amount of energy needed to change the temperature of
one gram of water by one degree Celsius at standard atmosphere pressure
and 20**Â°C. This amount of energy is very small; the calories typically
discussed in the context of food are kilocalories, 1000 of the calories
discussed here. A kilocalorie is the energy needed to change the
temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius at standard
atmospheric pressure and 20Â°C.

There are many different materials one could use in exploring thermal
phenomena. **The amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one
gram of a material by one degree Celsius is called the material's
*specific heat****.*

Water is the standard. **One calorie of energy is needed to raise a mass
of one gram of water by one degree Celsius** at standard atmospheric
pressure and 20Â°C**.** The symbol for specific heat is c. In this
course, water's specific heat is written c~w~ = 1.0 cal/(gÂ°C).

Note that the units for mass and temperature both are in the denominator
of this expression for specific heat. This is a mathematical way of
stating that the change in energy for water is one calorie to change
each gram by one Celsius degree. The dimensions of specific heat, c,
are:

.mathjax}

The units are:Â Â  ![\\frac{\\text{(calories)}}{\\text{(grams)(degrees

To express mathematically how much energy is gained or lost when
something is warmed or cooled:

-   What might be the effect of how much "stuff" is involved?
-   What might be the effect of the kind of "stuff" one has?
-   What might be the effect of how much the temperature changes?
-   How can you combine measures of these effects mathematically to
    estimate the energy lost by the hot water?

theoretical considerations mathematically.

: Table II.3 Developing a mathematical expression for change in energy

Â 

After completing Table II.3, look at an example of student work and
consider nuances about mathematical representations of thermal phenomena
based upon theoretical considerations.

#### *1. Example of student work about developing a mathematical expression for a change in energy* {#chapter-018-developing-a-mathematical-representation-of-thermal-phenomena-based-on-theoretical-considerations.html#U2H417}

*This section is an example of using mathematics to express some
theoretical insights. The ratios above do not directly address what is
happening conceptually in terms of energy transfers when mixing hot and
cold water. The considerations that one must make, including how much
material one has, what kind of material this is, and how much the
temperature changes, are indicated in (the table shown in Fig. 2.19
below.)*

***The bigger the mass of material, the more energy is lost or
gained.*** *The first row in (the table) presents this idea. For this
experiment, the more water that there was, the more energy was lost or
gained. This is because the more mass that a material has, the more
energy it will take to change things about the material, such as its
temperature. Since it takes 1 calorie to change 1 gram of water 1Â°C, the
greater the mass of the material, the more calories were needed, which
means that more energy was lost or gained.*

***The energy lost or gained also depends upon a property of the
material, its specific heat.*** *The second row in (the table) shows
this idea. Specific heat is defined as, c = the amount of energy (lost
or gained) to change the temperature of one gram of material by one
degree Celsius. Water is the standard, c~w~ = one calorie of energy that
is lost or gained when the temperature of one gram of water changes by
one degree Celsius (at standard atmospheric pressure and 20ÂºC).*

***The bigger the change in temperature, the more energy is lost or
gained.*** *This idea is displayed in the third row in (the table).
Since it takes 1 calorie to change 1 gram of water 1Â°C, the greater the
temperature change, the more calories were needed, meaning that more
energy was lost or gained.*

***Energy lost by the hot object equals the product of its mass,
specific heat, and change in temperature.*** *This idea is presented in
the fourth row of (the table). These variables are multiplied to express
mathematically the energy lost by the hot waterÂ  m~h~c~w~ âT~h~, because
in order to know how much energy is lost, you have to know how much
material is losing energy, the specific heat of that material, and the
change in temperature of that material. If you know all of that
information, you are able to multiply the three values together in order
to determine the amount of energy that is lost.*

#### *2. An analogy to specific heat and the mathematical expression for change in energy* {#chapter-018-developing-a-mathematical-representation-of-thermal-phenomena-based-on-theoretical-considerations.html#U2H418}

This progression of mathematical thinking can seem challenging. However,
exploring both experimental and theoretical approaches to relating
quantities is an important part of modeling phenomena in science.

The process of developing such mathematical expressions can increase
comfort with using subscripts, in interpreting expressions involving
multiple symbols, and in deepening understanding of what multiplication
represents in viewing m~h~c~w~âT~h~Â  as a meaningful expression for how
much a mass m~h~Â of hot water, with specific heat c~w~Â , changes in
energy when it cools by Â âT~h~ degrees in temperature when mixed with
cold water.

Sometimes it helps to consider an analogous situation:

-   How would you estimate the budget for a project if the basic cost,
    c, is the number of dollars paid for each hour worked by each
    person?

What would be the estimated budget for the project, for example, if you
hired 5 people at a cost of \$15/hour for each person who worked for 2
hours?

You would need: ![\\text{(5 people)}(\\frac{\\text{\\\$ 15}}{\\text{each
person, each hour}})\\text{(2 hours)} = \\\$
150](OEBPS/assets/a6574d9cd423184531d9398b08f26bb2.png "\text{(5 people)}(\frac{\text{\$ 15}}{\text{each person, each hour}})\text{(2 hours)} = \$ 150"){.latex
.mathjax}

Note that multiplication is indicated here by parentheses ( ) rather
than by x's in order to avoid confusion with situations in which an x
represents an unknown, which often occurs in algebraic equations.

In general, if n = the number of people, c = the cost for each person
for each hour, and ât = the estimated duration (final clock reading --
initial clock reading), i.e., the time in hours needed for this number
of people to complete the project, the budget would be:

![\\text{Number of dollars needed} = \\text{(number of
people)}(\\frac{\\text{dollars}}{\\text{personÂ  hour}})\\text{(estimated
number of
hours)}](OEBPS/assets/3d1e028149662ce976ec987086968018.png "\text{Number of dollars needed} = \text{(number of people)}(\frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{personÂ  hour}})\text{(estimated number of hours)}"){.latex
.mathjax}\
Budget needed for the project =Â  ncât

The mathematical reasoning for energy transfer is exactly the same:

-   How would you calculate the change in energy if the mass of the
    material was m, the specific heat of a material is "c," which is the
    number of calories needed for an energy change of one gram for each
    degree C change in temperature, and the material changed in
    temperature âT?

If m = mass in the number of grams,

c = energy in calories needed for each gram for each degree C change in
temperature, and

ÎT = change in temperature in number of degrees C,

the change in energy would be:

change in energy = mcÎT

Although it may be hard to view mcâT as a meaningful expression for
change in energy, one can focus on dimensions and see this as:

![\\text{change in energy} = \\frac{\\text{(mass) (energy)
(temperature)}}{\\text{(mass)(temperature)}} =
\\text{energy}](OEBPS/assets/059ff75f1fa1703f8f168c1b8e56f974.png "\text{change in energy} = \frac{\text{(mass) (energy) (temperature)}}{\text{(mass)(temperature)}} = \text{energy}"){.latex
.mathjax}

or focus on units and see this as:\
![\\text{change in energy} = \\frac{\\text{(\# of grams) (\# of calories
) (\# of degrees C change in T Â ) }}{\\text{(gram)(degree C)}} =
\\text{\# of
calories}](OEBPS/assets/462fb7d10d42c09ac207e561c86c5db5.png "\text{change in energy} = \frac{\text{(# of grams) (# of calories ) (# of degrees C change in T Â ) }}{\text{(gram)(degree C)}} = \text{# of calories}"){.latex
.mathjax}

It can be helpful in working thermal problems, to step back and evaluate
the dimensions on both sides of an equation to check that one has not
made an algebraic mistake inÂ  manipulating an equation to solve for an
unknown.

### **B. Considering the Law of Conservation of Energy** {#chapter-018-developing-a-mathematical-representation-of-thermal-phenomena-based-on-theoretical-considerations.html#U2H312}

##### ***Question 2.12 How does the energy gained by the cold water compare to the energy lost by the hot water, assuming no energy is gained by the surrounding environment?*** {#chapter-018-developing-a-mathematical-representation-of-thermal-phenomena-based-on-theoretical-considerations.html#U2H512 style="text-align: center"}

The total change in energy should equal the change in energy of the hot
water plus the change in energy of the cold water plus any change in
energy of the surroundings. This is a statement based on the *Law of
Conservation of Energy.* The word "conservation" here means that the
total amount of energy does not change when energy flows from one part
of a system to another or from one form into another.

This means that the total change in energy when hot and cold water mix
should equal 0. Total change in energy = change in energy of hot water +
change in energy of cold water + any energy flowing into the
surroundings.

If no energy flows into the surroundings:

m~h~c~w~âT~h~ +Â  m~c~c~w~âT~c~ Â = 0 Â  Â Â Â Â Â  Law of Conservation of
Energy

Note that because *â*T~h~ = T~hf~Â  --Â  T~hi~ and the final temperature
is always less than the initial temperature for the hot water,Â  *â*T~h~
is always negative, and therefore m~h~c~w~âT~h~Â  is always negative,
which can be interpreted as the energy lost by the hot water.

The energy lost by the hot water + energy gained by the cold water = 0,
makes sense as long as none of the energy lost by the hot water flows
into the air or the containers. This also means that the magnitude of
the energy lost by the hot water equals the magnitude of the energy
gained by the cold water as long as none of the energy lost by the hot
water flows into the air or the containers.

##### ***Question 2.13 How are these experimental and theoretical approaches related?*** {#chapter-018-developing-a-mathematical-representation-of-thermal-phenomena-based-on-theoretical-considerations.html#U2H513 style="text-align: center"}

According to the Law of Conservation of Energy, the total energy does
not change: Total change in energy = change of energy for hot water +
change in energy for cold waterÂ  = 0 if no energy flows into the
surroundings.

m~h~c~w~âT~h~ +Â  m~c~c~w~âT~c~ Â = 0Â Â  Law of Conservation of Energy

This algebraic relationship also can be written as: Â Â Â  m~h~c~w~âT~h~
Â Â = -- m~c~c~w~âT~c~

This equation tells us that the change in energy of the hot water is
*equal and opposite* to the change in energy of the cold water

This equation can be simplified by dividing both sides by c~w~, m~c~ and
âT~h~ in order to make ratios of m's and âT's:

![\\frac{m_h}{m_c} = - \\frac{\\Delta T_c}{\\Delta
T_h}](OEBPS/assets/fb6cfeb028e716fc76cc721373a91c2b.png "\frac{m_h}{m_c} = - \frac{\Delta T_c}{\Delta T_h}"){.latex
.mathjax}

This is the equation developed experimentally with approximate results!Â 
Thus the theoretical approach confirms the relationship evident in the
patterns of data obtained by measuring temperature changes when mixing
various configurations of hot and cold water.

One can work forwards from the experimental result by multiplying both
sides by m~c~ andÂ  âT~h~

and including the specific heat of water on both sides to obtain the
theoretical result:

m~h~ c~w~âT~h~Â  = -- m~c~c~w~âT~c~

One also can express this relationship in terms of magnitudes:

\|m~h~ c~w~âT~h~\| = \|m~c~c~w~âT~c~\|

Any of these approaches can be used in estimating a thermal quantity of
interest.

Qualitative approaches, such as interpreting the shapes of graphs, were
helpful in gaining a conceptual understanding about what is happening
when mixing hot and cold water. Quantitative approaches make possible
the making of predictions and estimation of quantities that may be of
interest.

### **A. Solving a thermal math problem** {#chapter-019-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-a-quantity-of-interest.html#U2H313}

In this section, we demonstrate how to solve thermal math problems in
the context of mixing hot and cold water. We assume that the specific
heat of water is the same over the range of temperatures between
freezing at 0ÂºC and boiling at 100ÂºC. We also assume that the specific
heat of water is the same as the specific heat of fluids such as tea,
milk, and cocoa when working thermal energy problems involving mixing
these substances. The same mathematical process also applies in more
complex situations in which the specific heat of the hot material
differs, however, from the specific heat of the cold material, when, for
example, a piece of hot metal is submerged into a cooling bath.

##### ***Question 2.14 How can one use mathematical representations of thermal phenomena*** ***to estimate a quantity of interest?*** {#chapter-019-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-a-quantity-of-interest.html#U2H514 style="text-align: center"}

After developing both experimental and theoretical ways to describe what
happens when mixing hot and cold water, one can use that knowledge to
generate and solve thermal math problems.

To make up a thermal math problem, decide on a scenario and specify
three of the four variables involved if only considering changes in
temperature:Â  mass of hot water, mass of cold water, magnitude in change
in temperature of hot water, or magnitude of change in temperature of
cold water. Also include information about one of the initial
temperatures or equilibrium temperatures. Use mass units (grams,
kilograms) or parts rather than volume units. If the scenario involves
materials with difference specific heats, be sure to include that
information in stating the problem and in calculating the answer.

As with solving pinhole math problems, the goal in solving a thermal
math problem is not the "answer." The goal is to build your ability to
help Â someone else understand what to do and why. Start by helping the
learner to understand what is happening by describing the scenario
verbally with words and visually with a sketch. Next review the physics
involved by stating whatÂ the relevant central ideas are. Also draw a
qualitative graph and use it and the central ideas to explain what is
happening. Then describe the graph mathematically, being clear about
what each symbol represents. Justify the equation that relates the
quantities represented; write the equation in both words and symbols.
Finally, solve for the unknown in symbols before substituting values.
After calculating an answer, be sure to also discuss why that answer
seems reasonable.

In facilitating a conversation with someone about thermal phenomena, ask
questions rather than tell answers throughout this process.Â [In solving

#### *1. Example of student work generating and solving a thermal math problem* {#chapter-019-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-a-quantity-of-interest.html#U2H419}

*Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The problem stated in words is: If you have 180 grams of
hot tea, and you want to cool it down by 20 degrees Celsius by adding 60
grams of cold water, how much will the temperature of the cold-water
change? Assume all of the energy lost by the tea is gained by the cold
water and that the specific heats of tea and water are the same. The
initial temperature of the cold water is 15 degrees Celsius. After
finding the change in temperature of the cold water, find the
equilibrium temperature and the initial temperature of the hot tea.*

*(As shown in Fig 2.21), below is a graph that represents the problem.
The first relevant idea is, when mixing unequal amounts of hot and cold
water, the ratio of the amount of hot water to the amount of cold water
is approximately equal to minus the ratio of the change in temperature
of the cold water to the change in temperature of the hot water. Next,
the energy lost by the hot object equals the product of its mass,
specific heat, and change in temperature. Finally, energy is conserved:
energy lost = energy gained, so when mixing hot and cold water, the
(magnitude of the) energy lost by the hot water equals (the magnitude
of) the energy gained by the cold water.*

*Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Symbols that are defined for the relevant quantities are
m~h~= mass of hot tea, m~c~= mass of cold water, âT~c~= change in
Temperature of cold water, and âT~h~= change in Temperature of hot tea.
An algebraic equation that relates these quantities in symbols is*

![\\frac{\\text{m}\_h}{\\text{m}\_c} \\approx \\frac{-\\Delta
T_c}{\\Delta
T_h}Â ](OEBPS/assets/fdd6f54963e1f601b047f9450ccc9ce1.png "\frac{\text{m}_h}{\text{m}_c} \approx \frac{-\Delta T_c}{\Delta T_h}Â "){.latex
.mathjax}

*The same equation in words is Â *

![\\frac{\\text{Mass of hot tea}}{\\text{Mass of cold water}} \\approx
\\frac{-\\text{change in Temperature of cold water}}{\\text{change in
Temperature of hot
tea}}](OEBPS/assets/cf36ea20b7090d2eedd58b77f038095e.png "\frac{\text{Mass of hot tea}}{\text{Mass of cold water}} \approx \frac{-\text{change in Temperature of cold water}}{\text{change in Temperature of hot tea}}"){.latex
.mathjax}

*This equation is justified because it is equivalent to the theoretical
statement of the Law of Conservation of Energy -- (m~h~ c~w~ âT~h~ ) = (
m~c~ c~w~ âT~c~), assuming that no energy is gained by the environment
such as the cup and air.*

*The unknown and the quantity to be calculated is the change in
temperature of the cold water, âT~c~. The symbols for the quantities I
have provided in the problem statement and their numerical values are
m~h~= 180 grams, m~c~= 60 grams, and âT~h~= -- 20Â°C.*

*The equation solved algebraically for the unknown isÂ  ![{\\Delta T_c} =
-{\\Delta T_h}
\\frac{{(\\text{m}\_h)}}{(\\text{m}\_c)}](OEBPS/assets/3da265b6234e49531532d604d5735b9d.png "{\Delta T_c} = -{\Delta T_h} \frac{{(\text{m}_h)}}{(\text{m}_c)}"){.latex
.mathjax}.*

*When I substitute the values above for the known quantities and then
calculate the answer I get*

![{\\Delta T_c} = -({-20\^{\\circ}C}) \\frac{\\text{(180
grams)}}{\\text{(60 grams)}} =
{\\text60}\^{\\circ}C](OEBPS/assets/3c482bdea2d9d1725cc84563500a57d7.png "{\Delta T_c} = -({-20^{\circ}C}) \frac{\text{(180 grams)}}{\text{(60 grams)}} = {\text60}^{\circ}C"){.latex
.mathjax}

*This answer is reasonable because there was a lot more hot water than
cold water which means that the temperature of the mixture will be
closer to the initial temperature of the hot water than the initial
temperature of the cold water. This means that the cold water should
have a greater temperature change than the hot water. The hot water had
a temperature change of -20Â°C, so this answer of the cold water having a
temperature change of 60Â°C is reasonable.*

*The initial temperature of the cold water was 15Â°C. Since we know the
initial temperature of the cold water, we are able to use equations to
solve for the initial temperature of the hot water and for the
equilibrium temperature. I can now write an algebraic equation for the
unknown of the equilibrium temperature, T~e~. That equation is T~e~Â  =Â 
T~c~ Â Â + âT~c~. When I substitute the values in I get T~e~ = 15Â°C +
60Â°C= 75Â°C.*

*Then, I can write an algebraic equation for the unknown of the initial
temperature of the hot tea. That equation is âT~h~. = T~e~Â  -- T~h~ Â Â so
T~h~Â  = T~e~Â  -- âT~h~ Â When I substitute the values in I get T~hÂ ~=
75Â°C -- (-) 20Â°C= 95Â°C. This initial hot temperature is 95Â°C which is
below boiling point and the initial cold temperature is 15Â°C which is
above freezing, which both seem reasonable. Cooling tea down to 75Â°C
also seems reasonable because this is below boiling point but above
freezing. If a student spills the tea, it is not hot enough to burn
them.*

Physics Student, Spring 2016

Actually 75Â°C is hot enough to burn one severely. Recommendations are
for 'hot' liquids to be at 60Â°C or less.

#### *1. Examples of student work about designing and solving thermal math problems* *with friends and/or family members* {#chapter-020-engaging-friends-or-family-members-in-exploring-thermal-phenomena.html#U2H420}

A student engaged her roommate in some qualitative thinking to develop
the relationship between masses of hot and cold water and their changes
in temperature:

*I explored thermal phenomena with my roommate M. Before experimenting,
I asked her what she thought would happen when we mixed the hot and cold
water and she said that it would become warm water. When I asked why her
explanation was just that the cold cools down the hot water while the
hot warms up the cold water.*

*I asked her to try mixing different amounts of water and predict what
would happen. We kept all of the results labeled in different cups to
compare their temperatures. We did not have a thermometer so we just had
to base everything on touch. I asked her to line up the cups from
hottest to coldest based on feeling.*

*M noticed that the hottest had the least amount of cold water in the
mixture and the coldest had the least amount of hot water. Since we were
not able to measure our temperatures at home, I showed Morgan the data
we had collected in class. I did not give her the equation we came up
with because I wanted to see where she would go with the information.*

*She asked me if the temperature changes always need to add up to a
specific number. I asked her to try it with different numbers than what
we got to see if that was the case. She realized that was wrong because
if there is a smaller gap between the temperatures, their temperature
differences would be smaller.*

*M was stumped so I tried having her look at the whole numbers without
the decimals. She then realized the big numbers were double the small
numbers. After looking at all of the data a little longer she realized
that if the amount of hot water was double the cold water, that the
temperature change of the cold water would be double that of the hot
water.*

*I then challenged her to imagine what the temperature change would be
like if it was 4 parts hot water and 1 part cold water. Immediately M
said that the temperature change of the cold water would be 4 times
greater than that of the hot.*

*I asked her if she could come up with an equation and she said it would
be hot water divided by cold water would be equal to hot water
temperature change divided by cold water temperature change. I asked her
to test it with the data. She then realized the second equation would
need to be cold temperature change over hot temperature change.*

*Once she had figured this out I asked her to figure out the temperature
change of cold water when 2g of cold water was mixed with 8g of hot
water. I also give her the temperature change of the hot water being 5C.
She then figured out that the temperature change of the cold water would
be 20C.*

*I used the same examples that had been used in class because I thought
it was a good progression of testing understanding. I learned the
importance of teaching in steps and building off previous knowledge.*

Physics student, Fall 2016

Another student engaged her boyfriend in some interesting thinking about
aspects that might affect what happens:

*When I asked my boyfriend what happens when you add 4 parts cold water
to 2 parts hot water, he said "the temperature increases and the mixture
gets warmer, because it's closer to the cold water. The heat goes into
the cold water". I said, "Right! Because energy transfers from hot water
to cold water."*

*When I asked him what other factors might affect the transfer of hot
water to cold, specifically when you pour the water in, he responded
that the container, the air, and the surface the cups are sitting on all
could affect the heat transfer.*

*Then we started talking about how these things may be affected. The
amount both containers would take in heat, would matter on what the
material it was made out of. M said, "If it was a thermos, it wouldn't
take in much heat, because the heat would be insulated in the cup."*

*We also talked about the temperature of the air where you were pouring.
Like if it was in Alaska, or Mexico the air surroundings would take in
either more or less depending on which.*

*Next I gave him a word problem on solving for the change in heat of hot
water. "What is the change of the hot water, when you have 30 g of hot
tea and add 20g of cold water to make it drinkable and the change in
temperature of the cold water is 15 degrees.*

*He was very confused by this complicated problem and thought that we
should match the A temperature with A change in temperature and B temp
with B change, to get a new temperature of C. But he did not know where
to take it from there.*

*I asked him if he remembered anything about specific heat and showed
him the equation to solve for the change in temp of hot water. He solved
the algebra easily, but said he probably couldn't come up with the
equation on his own and I agreed that I wasn't able to come up with it
on my own either.*

*He was on the same page as me about this problem, that the algebra made
sense and was easy, but it was the comprehending the bigger picture that
was hard to grasp, and thinking up the equation on your own.*

*I learned that sometimes teachers and learners have the same questions,
and that makes it easier to discuss and engage in thorough
investigations. Also I learned both having questions lessens the
"authoritarian" all knower- teacher type that teachers sometimes
possess. We engaged in discussion, using math to solve problems, and
analyzed and constructing explanations and designing solutions for the
science and engineering practice standards.*

What does *doing* science and engineering involve? Unit 1 introduced
common practices such as collecting, analyzing and interpreting data as
well as engaging in argument from such evidence. *Doing* science and
engineering also involves ways of thinking that bridge across different
science domains. What concepts, for example, do biologists, physicists,
and chemical engineers all use in their studies?

### **A. Learning about the USÂ *Next Generation Science Standards: Crosscutting Concepts*** {#chapter-021-making-connections-to-educational-policies-and-the-nature-of-science.html#U2H314 style="text-align: center"}

Many US states have adopted the *Next Generation Science Standards*
(NGSS Lead States, 2013) for guiding science instruction in their
schools. In addition to the science and engineering practices introduced
in Unit 1, these standards articulate a group of concepts that are
common across many science disciplines. Both the science and engineering
practices and these crosscutting concepts are intended to help students
learn about and participate in the nature of science.

##### ***Question 2.16 What relevant crosscutting concepts have you used in exploring light and thermal phenomena?*** {#chapter-021-making-connections-to-educational-policies-and-the-nature-of-science.html#U2H516 style="text-align: center"}

-   Go to <https://www.nextgenscience.org/get-to-know>
-   Click on Appendix G, scroll down the first page to the list of seven
    crosscutting concepts[Â that scientists and engineers use across many
    different contexts:]{style="font-size: 1em"}
    -   **Patterns**. Observed patterns of forms and events guide
        organization and classification, and they prompt questions about
        relationships and the factors that influence them.
    -   **Cause and effect**: Mechanism and explanation. Events have
        causes, sometimes simple, sometimes multifaceted. A major
        activity of science is investigating and explaining causal
        relationships and the mechanisms by which they are mediated.
        Such mechanisms can then be tested across given contexts and
        used to predict and explain events in new contexts.
    -   **Scale, proportion, and quantity**. In considering phenomena,
        it is critical to recognize what is relevant at different
        measures of size, time, and energy and to recognize how changes
        in scale, proportion, or quantity affect a system's structure or
        performance.
    -   **Systems and system models**. Defining the system under
        study---specifying its boundaries and making explicit a model of
        that system---provides tools for understanding and testing ideas
        that are applicable throughout science and engineering.
    -   **Energy and matter**: Flows, cycles, and conservation. Tracking
        fluxes of energy and matter into, out of, and within systems
        helps one understand the systems' possibilities and limitations.
    -   **Structure and function**. The way in which an object or living
        thing is shaped and its substructure determine many of its
        properties and functions.
    -   **Stability and change**. For natural and built systems alike,
        conditions of stability and determinants of rates of change or
        evolution of a system are critical elements of study
-   [Scan the discussion of these crosscutting concepts to see what they
    are and read about any that you find particularly
    interesting.]{style="font-size: 1em"}
-   Put a check in Table II.4 to indicate if you have used a
    crosscutting concept while exploring light and thermal phenomena in
    this course.
-   For each context, choose one or more crosscutting concepts and
    describe an example of what you did and learned.

### **B. Reflecting upon this exploration of thermal phenomena** {style="text-align: center"}

This unit began by considering what students already knew about thermal
phenomena. Children and adults have many experiences in which high
temperatures describe hot days and low temperatures describe cold days.
They also have many experiences touching objects of many kinds in which
some feel colder than others. These prior experiences often lead
students to rank paper or Styrofoam, wood, aluminum and steel in order
from higher to lower temperatures because these materials feel so
different to touch. Most students are surprised to find that items made
of these materials all are at the same temperature when measured by a
thermometer, rather than by their hands, if the materials have been in
the same room for a long time.

Understanding often emerges when someone mentions the idea of *room
temperature*, that objects that have been in the same room for a long
time are at the same temperature. A helpful nudge usually occurs when
someone comments that maybe the materials differ in what happens when
one touches them, that metal differs from paper or Styrofoam in some
way.

Eventually someone articulates the idea that energy is flowing from
one's hand into the metals, that metal is a conductor, and one's hand is
losing energy quickly so one's hand feels cold. Paper and Styrofoam,
however, are insulators; very little energy is flowing from one's hand
into the paper or Styrofoam, so one's hand stays warm. The materials
feel different because of their differences in the property of *thermal
conductivity*, in how well energy flows into and throughout the
material, but their temperatures are the same if left for a long time in
the same room.

This process is an example of what scientists and engineers do when they
observe something that seems puzzling. They try to figure out what might
be happening in order to explain that puzzle; theyÂ  ponder how to
reconcile different ideas that seem applicable but do not agree. This
process of refining one's ideas often involves separating and clarifying
the differences between some closely related concepts that seem
initially to be the same such as *heat* and *temperature*.

After developing relevant central ideas, this unit also modeled the next
step, of figuring out how to represent mathematically the relationships
one has been exploring with both experimental and theoretical
approaches. A series of experiments led to the inference of an *inverse
relationship* between the amounts of hot and cold water and their
changes in temperature when mixed. Many students express surprise at
this inverse relationship as their prior experiences with mathematical
ratios typically have been with direct relationships, such as the equal
ratios of heights and distances involved in pinhole phenomena. A
theoretical approach based on the *Law of Conservation of Energy,*
however, confirms this inverse relationship between the masses of hot
and cold water and their respective changes in temperature when mixed
together. A refinement involves recognizing that the property
ofÂ *specific heat* also affects how much energy is absorbed or released
when the temperature of a material changes. Development of an algebraic
equation representing these Â relationships makes possible numerical
predictions and estimates of quantities of interest.

Students may experience some of the frustration that scientists and
engineers often face as they struggle to perceive the patterns in their
data, particularly when our simple equipment does not yield precise
relationships but only trends when the data are compared in various
ways. Students also may experience, however, the pleasures that
scientists and engineers experience when finally recognizing and
confirming both the conceptual and mathematical models developed.

### **C. Making connections to NGSS understandings about the nature of science**

TheÂ *Next Generation Science Standards* recommends that students engage
in three dimensions of learning science by using science and engineering
practices and cross cutting concepts while learning disciplinary core
ideas. In this unit, for example, students used the science and
engineering practice of *analyzing and interpreting dataÂ *when they
tracked and interpreted initial and final temperatures while mixing
various amounts of hot and cold water. They became aware of the
importance of the crosscutting concepts of *systems and system
modelsÂ *while attempting to minimize energy flowing into the cups and
air by pouring the cold water into the hot water rather than the hot
water into the cold. During these explorations of thermal phenomena,
students learned disciplinary core ideas about *conservation of energy
and energy transfer.*

This unit also has provided additional examples of understandings about
the nature of science as articulated in Appendix H of theÂ *Next
Generation Science Standards
<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices> .* The
learning progression for the NGSS understanding thatÂ *science is a way
of knowing, f*or example, *i*ncludes that middle school students should
learn thatÂ *science is both a body of knowledge and the processesÂ and
practices used to add to that body of knowledge*. In this unit, for
example, students observed that materials left for a long time in the
same room have the same temperature even though the materials may feel
warmer or colder when touched. From this, the students gained new
knowledge about the role of an object's property, itsÂ *thermal
conductivity,Â *in the rate at which such energy transfers occur. By
mixing various amounts of hot and cold water, the students developed
mathematical ways of tracking the flow of energy in a relatively simple
system.Â This unit thus initiated explorations of such energy transfer
processes. This focus continues in considering more complex energy
transfer phenomena during local weather in Unit 3 and during global
climate change in Unit 4.

1.  **State the problem** in words
2.  **Make a sketch** of the amounts to be mixed
3.  **Review what you know** about the physics of this phenomenon: the
    relevant central ideas
4.  **Draw a graph representing the problem** (use a ruler to make
    straight perpendicular axes, draw flat horizontal lines to represent
    temperatures that are not changing before the two substances are
    mixed and the shared equilibrium temperature after the mixing, draw
    the appropriately shaped graph for mixing more hot than cold or more
    cold than hot or equal amounts. Draw the graph to indicate whether
    the changes in temperature happen very quickly or are gradual
    processes.**)**
5.  **Tell the 'story' of the graph** with the relevant central ideas to
    **explain** why the equilibrium temperature is likely to be where
    you have drawn it (nearer the temperature of the initial hot water,
    initial cold water, or in the middle.)
6.  **Represent this scenario mathematically**: **State the equationin
    words** that relates the masses of the substances mixed and their
    changes in temperature. Use the experimental form of the equation
    derived from your exploration or the theoretical form based on the
    Conservation of Energy and **justify the use of the equal sign**
    accordingly.
7.  **Define symbols, state equation in symbols**, and express how you
    are envisioning this equation.
8.  **Solve for the unknown** in symbols
9.  **Record given values and estimate any needed**
10. **Substitute values and calculate answer**
11. **Check answer**: why does the number you get from the calculation
    seem reasonable?

The theme for this course is *what happens when light from the Sun
shines on the Earth?Â * In this unit, you will be exploring the effect of
light and thermal phenomena on local weather. While exploring these
phenomena, you will be:

-   ***identifying resources*** such as everyday knowledge about water
    and weather
-   ***developing central ideas based on evidence*** about the water
    cycle
-   ***explaining intriguing phenomena*** such as why, during a sunny
    day at the beach, the sand is hot, the water cool, and cloudy skies
    as well as sea breezes often appear in the afternoon
-   ***developing mathematical representations*** of the transfer of
    energy in various contexts
-   ***using mathematical representations to estimate a quantity of
    interest*** such as predictions about "will it rain tomorrow"? and
-   ***making connections to educational policy***, such as the *Next
    Generation Science Standards* (NGSS Lead States, 2013), the science
    standards adopted by many US departments of education.

This unit continues exploration of learning processes as well as of
physical phenomena. Summarizing and reflecting upon these explorations
will foster integrating science and literacy learning. This includes
learning to speak clearly, listen closely, write coherently, read with
comprehension, and create and critique media.

The main sections present questions with suggestions for exploring
topics and for writing reflections about your findings. Text in gray
font indicates that these are suggestions; you may think of other ways
to explore the topic. Asking your own questions as well as those posed
here will enhance learning both about physics and about learning.Â Check
with your instructor if you choose to devise an alternative approach.

Keeping track of what one is doing and thinking is important. In this
course, use a template for a physics notebook page on which to record
your notes during class. The physics notebook page can help you remember
your thoughts *before, during,* and *after* an exploration. An
experienced elementary teacher, Adam Devittt, designed this notebook
page to mirror the structure of *before, during,* and *after*Â reading
strategies:

[Before]{style="text-decoration: underline"} starting your exploration,
think about and discuss with your group members what you know already
about the topic, how you plan to conduct the exploration, and what you
think you might find out.

[During]{style="text-decoration: underline"} your exploration, record
what is happening, what you are observing, and what you are thinking
about what you are observing. Include sketches of equipment and
observations. Note any words that are new and their definitions.

[After]{style="text-decoration: underline"} your exploration, record any
central ideas that have emerged from your observations and discussions.
Also note the evidence on which you have based these ideas. State
explicitly how the evidence is relevant and supports the claims you are
making in stating the ideas. Also explain why this result is important.
Then write a reflection about whatever you want to remember about this
experience. In addition, briefly state what you are still wondering in
this context.

After class, use your physics notebook pages and any handouts to write a
summary of your exploration and findings. Writing such a summary after
every class is a good way to prepare for the midterm and final
examinations.

Next, to be sure you have understood the physics involved, read this
text and some examples of student work. The student authors first wrote
drafts, received feedback for ways to enhance content and clarity, and
submitted these final versions. Also read about some nuances to be aware
of in these contexts.

You may also find helpful students' reflections about teaching friends
and/or family members about what they had just learned in class,
historical information about ways knowledge about the topic developed,
and some relevant aspects of the nature of science in the context of the
topic explored. These sections of the text may broaden your
understanding of science and of science learning and teaching.

Water is a central player in weather phenomena. The Greek stem *hydro*
for water has formed the basis of many English words related to water.

-   If a plant wilts, what can you do to revive it?
-   If you forget your water bottle on a long hike, what might happen to
    you?
-   What chemical element is a component of water?
-   Where is water found on a planet such as the planet Earth?

To *hydrate* something, for example, means to supply a liquid, usually
water, to someone or something that needs it; to be *dehydrated* means
to be lacking water. The element *hydrogen* is a component of water: two
atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen form one molecule of water (H~2~O).
The word *hydrosphere* refers to everywhere that water is found on
Earth.

### **A. Connecting to relevant knowledge and experiences** {#chapter-025-identifying-student-resources-3.html#U3H31}

Thinking about how water moves from place to place can provide resources
on which to build in learning about weather phenomena.

##### ***Question 3.1 What do you already know about water and weather?*** {#chapter-025-identifying-student-resources-3.html#U3H51 style="text-align: center"}

-   Look at a cup of water. How did the water get there?

Trace the paths that the water in this cup might have followed to get to
where you can see it here.

how it moves from place to place. Record some of your ideas before
reading an example of student work.

#### *1. Example of student work about early experiences with water and weather* {#chapter-025-identifying-student-resources-3.html#U3H41}

A student wrote:

*In my early years of elementary school, I was taught about the water
cycle. When I learned about the water cycle, I learned about the terms
that could apply to experiences that I have previously had as a child.
For example, I learned that condensation describes the droplets that
form on the outside of my water bottle that has ice water in it. Next, I
learned that precipitation is what describes that rain that I have seen
falling from the sky. Finally, I learned that evaporation is what
describes when a water puddle that I see is gone a few hours later.
These are experiences that are likely to occur for students, so it is
important that they understand what they observe.*

Understanding the physical phenomena underlying the water cycle is the

### **B. Documenting initial ideas about changes in states of matter** {#chapter-025-identifying-student-resources-3.html#U3H32}

Water exists on Earth in several *states of matter*: solid, liquid, and
gas. These also are called *phases of matter*. Ice cubes melting, a
puddle of water evaporating, water vapor condensing into fog, and the
surface of a pond freezing over are examples of *changes in state* or
*phase changes.*

#### *1. Diagnostic Question about States of Matter* {#chapter-025-identifying-student-resources-3.html#U3H42}

Responding to the diagnostic question below will document some of your
initial knowledge about the roles of heat and temperature during changes
in states of matter.

Diagnostic Question about Changes in States of Matter

Some ice and a little liquid water are placed in a pot on a hot plate.\
When the hot plate is turned on, the ice begins to melt.\
After the ice melts, the liquid water warms, and eventually begins to
boil.\
The boiling continues until the pot is removed from the hot plate.

Â 

How does the temperature change during this process?\
Illustrate your prediction with a graph of temperature versus time.

different ideas. The next exploration extends this development to
examine what happens when water changes state.

To explore changes in state, assemble:

-   rice cooker, pot and hot plate, or pot and stove
-   tray of ice cubes
-   thermometer
-   large binder clip.

We use a digital temperature probe connected to a computer that displays
a continuous record of the temperature (see
<https://www.vernier.com/product-category/?category=temperature-sensors>).
We set the duration for 1800 seconds (30 minutes) and the temperature
scale from aboutÂ  -5 Â°C to about 110Â°C. A regular bulb and tube
thermometer will work if the scale ranges at least from a little below
the freezing point of water (0Â°C) to a little above its boiling point
(100Â°C).

-   In the ***Before*** section of your physics notebook page, predict
    how the temperature of water changes when a container of ice cubes
    is placed on a heater and the ice melts, the liquid water warms, and

graph.
:::
:::

::: {.bc-section .section}
***Water occurs on Earth in three states of matter: solid (ice and
snow), liquid (ground water, streams, oceans, clouds), and gas (water
vapor).*** *Water occurs on Earth in three states of matter. The first
state of matter in which water occurs is as a solid. This is when water
is in the form of snow or ice. When the same water is heated, it can be
in the state of matter of a liquid. This is when water is in the form of
ground water, streams, oceans, and clouds. When the same water is
boiled, it can be in the state of matter of a gas. This is when the
water is in the form of water vapor.*

***When solid water (ice) is melting, energy enters the system but the
temperature does not change.*** *(Row 1 of Fig. 3.1) shows a graph of
Temperature vs. time. In row 2, the relevant part of the graph is
highlighted. The highlighted part shows what is happening when solid
water (ice) is melting. When the ice is melting, energy is entering the
system. In the graph, it is seen that the temperature does not change,
even though energy enters the system.*

***When liquid water is heated and energy enters the system at a steady
rate, the temperature increases at a steady rate. (*** *Row 1 of Fig.
3.1) shows a graph of Temperature vs. time. In row 3, the relevant part
of the graph is highlighted. The highlighted part shows what is
happening when liquid water is heated. When liquid water is heated,
energy from the heat of the rice cooker is entering the system at a
steady rate. The graph shows that the temperature is also increasing at
a steady rate.*

***When liquid water is evaporating, energy enters the system but the
temperature does not change. (*** *Row 1 of Fig. 3.1) shows a graph of
Temperature vs. time. In row 4, the relevant part of the graph is
highlighted. The highlighted part shows what is happening when liquid
water is evaporating. When liquid water is evaporating, energy is
entering the system. The graph shows that the temperature does not
change, even though energy enters the system.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

This student has interpreted the flat areas of the graph as phase
changes that occurred in which energy continued to flow into the system
but the temperature did not change while the ice was melting and while
the liquid water was evaporating.

#### *2. Nuances about changes in states of matter* {#chapter-026-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-3.html#U3H44}

This exploration provides an example of refining understandings about
the difference between heat and temperature by considering the context
of application. Many students draw a straight line when predicting the
graph of temperature versus time for melting ice, warming liquid water,
and boiling. Such a straight line can seem reasonable given prior
experiences in warming things up. A straight line is appropriate for the
context of warming the liquid water. When liquid water is warming up,
adding energy to the system at a steady rate increases the temperature
at a steady rate and a straight inclined line on a temperature versus
time graph represents that regular increase in temperature with time.

In the context of changes in state, however, [the temperature does not
change]{style="text-decoration: underline"} when adding energy to the
system if ice is melting or liquid water is evaporating. The heater is
supplying a constant flow of energy into the system of the pot of
melting ice or boiling water but the temperature does not change. The
temperature does not change because the energy is going into the melting
process or into the evaporation process.

According to the learning progression for the structure of matter
(PS1.A) articulated in the *Next Generation Science Standards* (Lead
States, 2013), in the early elementary grades students are to focus upon
observable properties such as whether a substance is a solid, liquid, or
gas. Young students are not expected to envision what is happening to
particles too small to see. By middle school, however, students are
expected to understand that materials are composed of atoms and
molecules, that atoms and molecules vibrate while bound together firmly
in solids and loosely in liquids, and that atoms and molecules are free
to move around in gases.

Changes in temperature involve changes in the *kinetic energy* of the
molecules. *Kinetic energy* refers to energy associated with motion.
Higher temperatures are associated with higher vibration rates among
molecules in solids and liquids and with higher speeds for molecules in
gases. See
[<https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/states-of-matter-basics>]{style="text-decoration: underline"}
for a simulation for the movement of water molecules in solid, liquid,
and gaseous states.

During melting and evaporating, the incoming energy goes into breaking
bonds between the molecules in solids and liquids rather than into
increasing the rates of vibration. During freezing and condensing,
energy is released as such bonds form among atoms and molecules.

The energy involved in changing states is known as *latent heat.* The
adjective *latent* refers to something that is hidden or concealed.
*Latent heat* refers to incoming or outgoing energy that is not
detectable by a change in temperature. The energy needed to melt a gram
of ice, the *latent heat of melting*, is about 80 calories. The energy
released when a gram of liquid water freezes, the *latent heat of
fusion*, also is about 80 calories. The energy needed to evaporate a
gram of liquid water, the *latent heat of vaporization*, is about 533
calories. The energy released when a gram of water vapor condenses, the
*latent heat of condensation*, is also about 533 calories.

Scientists and engineers design and use *phase change materials* to cool
buildings. Microscopic pellets of phase change materials added to
insulation absorb energy as they melt during the day, for example,
keeping a roof cool, and release energy as they freeze at night. See
[<http://tll.mit.edu/help/latent-heat>]{style="text-decoration: underline"}
for a discussion of latent heat and its engineering application in
designing ways to cool buildings. This is an example of *Identifying
situations that people want to change as a problem that can be solved
through engineering,* an aspect of *engineering design* that children as
young as K-2 are expected to understand according to the *Next
Generation Science Standards* (NGSS, Lead States, 2013) (See NGSS
Appendix I <https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices> .

### **B. Exploring phase changes in which water absorbs or releases energy** {#chapter-026-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-3.html#U3H34}

The *water cycle*, sometimes called the *hydrologic cycle,* involves
water in its many phases and phase changes. The phase changes occur both
when water is absorbing energy as well as when it is releasing energy.
Such phenomena are the focus of the next explorations.

##### ***Question 3.3 What are some everyday examples of water [absorbing]{style="text-decoration: underline"} energy when water changes state?*** {#chapter-026-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-3.html#U3H53 style="text-align: center"}

*Relative humidity* compares how much water vapor is in the air to how
much water vapor the air can hold at a given temperature. A prediction
of hot muggy weather with high relative humidity means that the air will
be very humid, holding close to as much water vapor as possible. This
means that very little perspiration will be able to absorb energy from
your body and cool you by evaporating from your skin.

If the temperature gets cold enough, a liquid freezes into a solid form.
This can occur in a controlled situation in a refrigerator or in nature
during a winter storm. As liquid water freezes, energy is released.Â Some
farmers spray crops like oranges with water to protect the crops from
freezing. Why would this work? See:

### **C. Exploring convection phenomena** {#chapter-026-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-3.html#U3H35}

Liquids and gases are called *fluids.* Fluids can flow from one place to
another. When streams of warm and cool liquid water are flowing nearby,
*convection* phenomena occur. Convection also occurs with nearby streams
of warm and cool air.

#### *1. Nuances about convection phenomena* {#chapter-026-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-3.html#U3H45}

Convection phenomena occur when fluids differ in how dense they are.
Density is a measure of how much mass a material has in a given volume.
Something will sink in a fluid if it has more mass in a given volume
than the fluid; something will rise in a fluid if it has less mass than
the fluid in a given volume.

In this course, we measure mass in grams and volume in cubic
centimeters. At standard atmospheric pressure, room temperature water
(about 21ÂºC) has a density of about 0.998 grams per cubic centimeter.
Hot water close to boiling (about 93ÂºC) has a density of about 0.963
grams per cubic centimeter, so it rises in the room temperature water.
Cold water melting from an ice cube (about 4Â°) has a density of about
1.000 grams per cubic centimeter so it sinks in the room temperature
water (see: <https://water.usgs.gov/edu/density.html>). These small
differences in density of warm and cold water are enough to cause the
convection currents observed.

Ocean currents are caused both by differences in temperature and by
differences in salinity. Warm water from the tropics moves near the
surface of the oceans toward the poles; cold water from the poles, being
more dense, flows toward the tropics at a deeper level. Fresh water from
melting glaciers reduces salinity; freezing sea ice leaves salt and
other minerals behind in the ocean, increasing salinity with saltier
water sinking and fresh water rising. Currents of water travel across
the globe via the *Great Ocean Conveyor Belt,* which takes about
1000-1200 years for water to circulate throughout the global system
(see: <https://www.weather.gov/jetstream/circulation> ).

### **D. Summarizing the water cycle** {#chapter-026-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-3.html#U3H36}

A variety of physical processes underlie the phases and
changes-in-phases of water known as the water cycle.

##### ***Question 3.6 What is the water cycle?*** {#chapter-026-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-3.html#U3H56 style="text-align: center"}

The water cycle includes the phases of solid (ice and snow), liquid
(ground water, lakes, streams, rivers, ocean), and gas (water vapor), in
addition to the changes-in-phases known as freezing, melting,
sublimating, evaporating, transpiring, perspiring, and condensing.
Briefly describe each exploration in Table III.2.

Â 

In row 1, which focused upon evaporation, the student drew a picture of
a sun shining on a puddle with arrows pointing upward representing
evaporating water, the natural phenomenon being modeled by the equipment
drawn in the upper right corner, a tray with a puddle of water on which
a lamp is shining. The student wrote, *On a warm day where it rained the
day before, mud puddles dry up* and added the statement, *There was less
water in the tray at the end of class than there was at the beginning of
class*.

In row 2, which focused upon sublimation, the student drew a picture of
the sun shining on ice on a mountain with arrows pointing upward
representing water sublimating directly from ice into water vapor. The
student wrote, *On a cold, dry day, ice will go away without any water
being seen.*

In row 3, which focused upon transpiration, the student drew a picture
of a lamp shining on a plant enclosed in a clear plastic bag. The
student wrote, *Water was seen on the plastic bag around the plant*.

In row 4, which focused upon condensation, the student drew a picture of
a large jar filled part way with warm water, with a cup with ice cubes
sitting in its opening, and droplets of water on the bottle. The student
wrote, *I can see water droplets on the outside of a water bottle that
has ice in it*.

In row 5, which focused upon precipitation, the student drew a picture
of a rain falling from a cloud. The student wrote, *We see this when it
rains*.

In row 6, which focused upon the force of gravity by the Earth, the
student drew a picture of a waterfall and wrote, *A water fall flows
downhill*.

In row 7, which focused upon convection, the student drew a picture of a
clear plastic container filled with water, with a blue ice cube floating
at the left end with melting blue water streaming down and with a hot
cup under red food color at the right end with a stream of red water
floating up and over toward the ice cube. The student wrote, *The hot
water (red food coloring) rised and the cold regions (blue ice) sank*.

In row 8, which focused on the water cycle, the student drew a picture
of the sun, shining on a puddle with arrows, representing evaporating
water, pointing up toward a cloud and with raindrops falling down. The
student wrote, *The water cycle is visible to us: rain creates puddles
that dry up*.

The student wrote the following rationales for the central ideas claimed
in the third column of the table:

***Sunlight shining on Earth sometimes supplies enough energy for some
of the liquid water in the soil and bodies of water to evaporate.*** *My
sketch of the evaporation demonstration is seen in (row 1of the table).
For this demonstration, we had a tray of water, which represents some of
the liquid water in the soil and bodies of water. There was also a lamp
that was shining on the water, which represents the sunlight shining on
the Earth. In this demonstration, we observed the water at the beginning
of class and at the end of class. Since there was less water in the tray
at the end of class than at the beginning of class, this shows that some
water was evaporated. This model is a demonstration that shows that
sunlight shining on earth sometimes supplies enough energy for some of
the liquid water in the soil and bodies of water to evaporate.*

***Sunlight shining on Earth sometimes supplies enough energy for snow
and ice to sublimate directly into the gaseous phase.*** *Â Sublimation
occurs if snow or ice vaporizes directly into the gaseous phases without
first melting and going through the liquid phase.*

***Water also evaporates from plants. This is called transpiration*** *.
My sketch of the transpiration demonstration is seen in (row 3 of the
table). For this demonstration, a plastic Ziploc bag was placed around a
plant. A lamp was shining on the plant. Some water droplets were able to
be seen on the bag, which demonstrates this process of water evaporating
from plants, which is called transpiration.*

***Condensation occurs when warm moist air cools; gaseous water (water
vapor) condenses into liquid water droplets to form clouds, fog, or
dew*** *. My sketch of the condensation experiment is seen in (row 4 of
the table). For this experiment, a jar was filled with warm water. Then,
a container with ice in it was placed on the top of the jar. The warm
moist air that is in the jar, below the container, cools because of the
ice in the container on the top of the jar. Water droplets form on the
bottom of the container and on the sides of the jar, which is the
gaseous water that has condensed into liquid water droplets. This
process of the gaseous water condensing into liquid water droplets is
how clouds form.*

***Precipitation occurs when water droplets condense, coalesce, and fall
to the Earth as rain, snow, or hail*** ***.*** ***Rain falls to Earth
and water flows downhill due to the force by the Earth known as
gravity*** ***.*** *My sketch of a precipitation demonstration is seen
on (rows 5 and 6 of the table). First, I drew water droplets falling to
the Earth as rain, which shows the process of precipitation. Then, I
drew the water flowing downhill in the form of a waterfall, due to the
force of gravity.*

***Temperature differences within fluids cause differences in density.
Less dense warm regions rise and more dense cool regions sink. This
process is called energy transfer by convection.*** *My sketch of the
convection experiment can be seen in (row 7 of the table). For this
experiment, a container of room temperature water was placed on four
cups. Warm water was colored red by food coloring and was warmed by very
hot water that was placed directly below the food coloring. The warm
water first rose up from the bottom of the container toward the top, and
then it started moving horizontally along the top of the water toward
the ice cube. Then, the blue ice cube that was placed on the top of the
water was observed. The blue melted water first sank down to the bottom
of the water and then it moved horizontally along the bottom of the
container toward the red food coloring. These movements set up a
circular current within the container. The hot water rising and the cold
water sinking created convection currents. This idea of warm regions
rising and cool regions sinking can also be seen in ocean currents.*

FIG 3.16 Example student's diagram of the water cycle.
:::
:::

The student has included labels with the phase changes of *evaporation,
sublimation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, freezing and
melting* as well as illustrations of snow on the mountains, rain
falling, clouds in the sky, and bodies of liquid water on the Earth. The
student described the water cycle as follows:

*First of all, the sun heats up the water and turns it into water vapor.
The water vapor leaves the source and goes into the air. The water vapor
comes from different forms of water on earth such as lakes and rivers
through the process of evaporation, it comes from plants through the
process of transpiration, and it comes straight from ice or snow without
melting first through the process of sublimation. Once the water vapor
rises, it goes through the process of condensation. Condensation is when
the water vapor in the air becomes cold and turns back into a liquid,
forming clouds. Once enough water has condensed and the clouds are full,
the water falls to the ground, which is known as precipitation. Some of
the water falls back into oceans, lakes, rivers, or other water sources.
Other parts of that water can be stored in ice or snow, which is known
as freezing. Then, when that frozen snow or ice becomes liquid water
again, this is known as melting. This process of the water cycle is
continuous and will repeat itself again and again.*

A sunny day at the beach can be a lot of fun. Why does the sand get so
hot, however, while the water is so cool when the sun has been shining
on both the sand and the water in the same way for the same time?
Sometimes the sky clouds over and a breeze comes up in the afternoon.
Why does that happen? This section explores how light and thermal
phenomena sometimes affect the local weather during a sunny day at the
beach.

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;padding: 5px"}
Equipment: To explore the effects of various properties on what happens
when light shines on sand and water, use:

-   Lamp with bendable stem,
-   Light probe connected to a computer with graphing software or cell
    phone app for reflectivity (LUX meter)
-   Black paper, white paper
-   Two identical clear cups
-   Balance
-   **Sand and** **water at room temperature**
-   Two temperature probes, and a computer or two regular bulb and tube
    thermometers with a range from at least about 15Â°C to 35Â°C.

\[In a remote learning situation, brown rice, split peas, or dried beans
can serve as a substitute for sand if necessary. A simple balance can be
made with a board (a ruler will do) and something on which to balance it
like a playground teeter totter. Set this up so it is balanced and then
use two identical clear cups to put about half a cup of water on one
side and as much sand as you need to balance it on the other side. \]

-   What properties of sand and water might affect what happens when
    light from the Sun shines in the same way for the same time on both
    the sand and the water?
-   In the ***Before*** section of a physics notebook page, record your
    ideas and predictions about the effect of properties explored in
    units 1 and 2: reflectivity, thermal conductivity, and specific
    heat. How can you explore the effects of these properties of sand
    and water on what happens when sunlight shines on a beach?

of materials.

:::

In row 1, the student drew a picture of a light shining on white and
black paper. The student wrote, *The graph showed an increase when the
probe was over the white paper, decreased when over black paper*.

In row 2, the student drew a picture of a cup with sand and a cup with
water, each with a temperature probe, and a light shining on the cups.
(Note that the student indicated more rather than less sand than water.)
The student wrote, *The water stays the same temp throughout, meaning
the energy is throughout. The sand is cooler on the bottom so the energy
isn't transferred.*

In row 3, the student drew a picture of a cup of sand and a metal plate,
with a light shining on each, and notes *sand isn't thermally
conductive* and *metal plate is thermally conductive*. The student
wrote, *The sand was more dense than the water, but was less thermally
conductive. This differs from the more dense metal plate being highly
thermally conductive*.

In row 4, the student drew a picture of a light shining on a cup with
sand and a cup with water. The student wrote, *Supported by the sand
heating up more than the water in the same time with the same amount of
energy put in*. (Note that the student again drew containers with higher
rather than lower sand than water).

In row 5, the student drew a sun shining on a beach with sand and water,
with labels *equal throughout* in the water and *sand heats at top* in
the sand. The student wrote, *The water and the sand take in energy
differently, the sand absorbs and the water reflects some.Â  The sand is
less thermally conductive, the water is more thermally conductive.* The
student also drew a light and a dark arrow with the note *don't use the
energy*.

The student wrote the following rationales for the ideas claimed in the
third column of the table:

***Materials differ in the property of reflectivity, how well they
reflect light. Corollary: Materials differ in how well they absorb
light. ...**The white paper showed an increase on the graph, because it
has greater reflectivity and the black paper showed a decrease on the
graph, because it has lower reflectivity. We also compared the
reflectivity of the dry sand and water with a light sensor. The
reflectivity of water depends upon the angle at which the light source
is shining on the water. Water is highly absorbent when the Sun in high
and more reflective when the sun is shining on it at an angle...*

***Materials differ in the property of thermal conductivity*** *.
Thermal conductivity is how well a material transfers energy. The second
row of (the table) shows the light source shining equally on the equal
masses of water and sand. For ten minutes the light was shining over
both cups with temperature probes in the cups.*

*After ten minutes, the water warmed from an initial temperature of
21.6ÂºC to 22.9ÂºC throughout the cup of water. The temperature near the
top of the sand was 31.1ÂºC. The temperature near the bottom of the sand
was the same as the initial temperature, which was 24.4ÂºC. I would infer
that the water has higher thermal conductivity because the temperature
was the same throughout the substance, meaning energy was transferred
from the top to the rest of the liquid.*

*The same amount of light shined for the same amount of time on the same
mass of water and dry sand, but the temperature of the sand was hotter
on the top than the bottom. The water was the same temperature
throughout, therefore the sand kept more of the energy it absorbed near
the surface of the sand.*

***Materials differ in the property of density, how much mass there is
in one unit of volume.*** *The third row of (the table) describes this
idea. When I was filling the cups with equal masses of sand and water I
had to add some sand. I added a little bit of sand and put the cup on
the scale, which showed the sand weighed much more than the water. I
poured a little of the sand out and scale showed the sand cup was much
lighter than the water. The little bit of the sand made a big
difference, showing sand is dense. The sand was denser, so there was
less sand (by volume) in the cup than water in the cup. If sand was
added to water, the sand would sink to the bottom, demonstrating the
sand is denser. Water is the standard, so the mass of one gram of water
has a volume of one cubic centimeter at 4ÂºC. The density of the sand is
approximately 1.6 grams for each cubic centimeter.*

*The metal plate appeared denser than the Styrofoam plate that we
experimented with before. The metal plate had more thermal conductivity
than the Styrofoam plate, which was demonstrated by the cool feeling we
experienced when touching the metal plate. When touching the Styrofoam
plate there was no temperature change felt. The sand was denser than the
water, but as demonstrated above, the sand had lower thermal
conductivity. This is evidence that there is no relation between the
properties of density and thermal conductivity.*

***Materials differ in the property of specific heat, how much energy in
calories is needed to change the temperature of one gram by one degree
Celsius*** *. The fourth row of (the table) represents this idea. Water
is the standard, meaning one calorie is needed to change the temperature
of one gram of water by one degree Celsius, at standard atmospheric
pressure and 20ÂºC. This can be shown by c~water~ =1 cal/(g ÂºC). The
specific heat of sand is smaller; sand only needs approximately 0.2
calories to change one gram of sand by one degree Celsius. This can be
represented by c~sand~ =0.2 cal/(g ÂºC).*

*These ideas can be used to decide which material changes temperature
more. If the sand and the water have the same mass, the sand will change
temperature more. Less energy is needed to change one gram of sand by
one degree Celsius than is needed for water; it only takes 0.2 calories
to change one gram of sand one degree Celsius while water needs one
calorie to change one gram of water by one degree Celsius. One calorie
of energy from the Sun will change one gram of water one degree Celsius.
For sand, one calorie of energy from the Sun will change one gram of
sand by five degrees Celsius. Therefore, sand will change temperature by
five degrees more.*

***Materials differ in how their properties affect what happens when
they convert light energy into energy that warms a surface.*** *Two cups
were filled with equal masses of water and dry sand. These cups were
placed under a light where the light could shine on them equally for an
equal amount of time. When light shined equally on the equal masses of
the sand and water, the water heated evenly throughout the cup. The sand
was warmer near the surface but remained the initial temperature near
the bottom of the cup. The sixth row of (the table) shows this idea.*

*Figure (3.19) shows the graph that represents our findings over ten
minutes. The graph shows both water and sand increased in temperature
gradually and constantly. The temperature of the sand increased more
than the temperature of the water. The initial temperature of the sand
was 24.4ÂºC, which increased to 31.1ÂºC. The initial temperature of the
water was 21.6ÂºC which increased to 22.9ÂºC.*

*Water is more thermally conductive than sand. This is demonstrated by
the temperature of the water being the same throughout the cup. Sand has
a low thermal conductivity, demonstrated by the differences in
temperature between the surface of the sand and the bottom of the sand.*

*The temperature of the sand (near the surface) increased more than the
temperature of the water even though they were exposed to the same
amount of energy for the same amount of time. This demonstrates that
sand has a smaller specific heat. One gram of sand can change one degree
Celsius with only 0.2 calories of energy, which means the sand needs
less energy than water to change the same amount in temperature, which
is shown on the graph.*

FIG. 3.19 Student's graph of temperature changes for sand and water
:::

Physics student, Spring 2016

*2. Nuances about the exploration of effects of properties of materials*

*(a) Noticing the lack of a relationship between the properties of
thermal conductivity and density.*

As this student noted clearly above, this exploration refutes the
tempting inference that thermal conductivity and density are related.
Although the more dense metal blocks were also more thermally conductive
in the exploration in Unit 2, here the less dense water was more
thermally conductive than the more dense sand.

The temperature of the sand near the bottom of the cup was lower than
the temperature of the sand at the top of the cup. From this we inferred
that the energy absorbed by the sand near the top of the cup stayed near
the top of the cup rather that spreading throughout the sand, that sand
has a low thermal conductivity. The temperature of the water near the
bottom of the cup, however, was the same as the temperature of the water
near the top of the cup. From this we inferred that some of the energy
absorbed by the water near the top of the cup flowed throughout the
water in the cup rather than staying on the surface, that water has a
high thermal conductivity.

These results indicate that in this case the more dense material, sand,
had a lower thermal conductivity than the less dense material, water.
This is opposite to the earlier result in Unit 2 in which we inferred
that the more dense materials, the 2 metals, had higher thermal
conductivities than the less dense materials, wood and Styrofoam. These
contradictory results indicate that there is no relation between the
properties of thermal conductivity and density.

*(b) Interpreting the difference in initial heights of the lines in Fig.
3.19.* Visually it is clear from the graph that the temperature of the
sand changed more rapidly than the temperature of the water. The lines
do not start at the same height, however, as would be expected if the
sand and water started at the same temperature. It is not clear whether
the sand and water were at different temperatures at the start of the
experiment, whether the temperature probes were not calibrated so they
did not read the same temperature although the sand and water actually
were at the same temperature, or whether the temperatures of the sand
and water were already different at the instant in time that the
computer started displaying the graph because the students turned on the
light before they started the computer program recording the temperature
probes. It is important to turn on the computer first, to document that
the sand and water are starting out at the same temperature. Then turn
on the light to start the warming process. It is clear from the graph,
however, that the temperature probe in the sand increased in temperature
much faster than the temperature probe in the water.

*(c) Interpreting the slopes of the lines in Figs. 3.17 and 3.19.* The
vertical axes of the graphs shown in Fig. 3.17 and Fig. 3.19 represent
the temperature of the sand (red line) and water (blue line). The
horizontal axes represent the time that the lamp was shining on the sand
and water. The *height* of the line at any point represents the
temperature at that instant of time. The *slope* of the line represents
how much the height changed during some time interval. The horizontal
axis is marking off time in one-minute time intervals. For these graphs,
the slope of the line represents how much the temperature was changing
during one minute of time.

Because the lamp was the same distance away from the sand and water, the
horizontal axis represents not only the time that the light was on but
also the incoming energy shining on the sand and water. Therefore **the
slopes of the lines also represent how much the temperatures of sand and
water were changing for each unit of incoming energy**.

The straight lines indicate that these slopes were constant, that the
temperature of the sand was changing at the same rate at the end of the
ten minutes as it was changing at the beginning of the ten minutes that
the light was shining on the cups of sand and water. The same was true
for the water, that the rate of change of temperature for each unit of
time was constant for the water.

*(d) Comparing the slopes of the lines.* How did the slope of the line
for the sand compare to the slope of the line for the water? Clearly the
slope of the red line, representing how much the temperature changed for
sand for each unit of energy, was greater than the slope of the blue
line, representing how much the temperature changed for water for each
unit of energy absorbed.

*(e) Relating the slopes of the lines to the specific heats of sand and
water.* How does this result for the slopes of the lines relate to a
comparison of the specific heats of sand and water? As discussed in Unit
2, a material's *specific heat* is the amount of energy needed to change
the temperature of a mass of one gram of the material by a temperature
of one degree C. A table of specific heats (See
<http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/specific-heat-capacity-d_391.html> )
lists the specific heat of sand as 0.19 cal/(gÂºC) and the specific heat
of water as 1.00 cal/(gÂºC).

If the specific heat of sand is about 0.2 cal/ gÂºC, how much would the
temperature of 1 gram of sand increase if it absorbed 1 calorie of
energy?Â  If a gram of sand increases in temperature by 1ÂºC when it
absorbs 0.2 cal of energy and the sand absorbs (0.2 cal + 0.2 cal + 0.2
cal +0.2 cal + 0.2 cal) of energy, how much does its temperature
increase?

If the specific heat of water is 1.0cal/gÂºC, how much would the
temperature of 1 gram of water increase if it absorbed 1 calorie of
energy?

For each calorie of energy absorbed by a gram of sand, the temperature
of the sand goes up about 5 degrees C compared to one degree C for each
calorie of energy absorbed by a gram of water. This major difference in
the properties of sand and water has major implications for what happens
when light from the Sun shines on sand and water at the beach! The
difference in their specific heats is the primary cause of why the sand
gets hot and the water stays cool during a sunny day at the beach.

*(f) Considering the effect of the property of reflectivity.* In our
course, students sometimes obtain different results for the property of
reflectivity; some report the water reflects more than the sand and some
less. It seems to depend upon the angle at which they hold the light
probe. To what extent is this a problem for interpreting results?

The percent of incident light reflected is called a material's *albedo*.
Water's albedo depends upon many aspects, including whether the sun is
shining straight down (low albedo) or at an angle (high albedo) as shown
in Fig. 3.20. The water absorbs more of the Sun's energy when the Sun is
high in the sky than when the Sun is rising or setting.

Water's albedo also depends upon its state, whether it is liquid in the
ocean, bare ice, or ice with snow. Fresh snow reflects the most, about
90%, whereas liquid water in the oceans reflects very little, about 6%
Â as shown in Fig. 3.21. Â Desert sand reflects about 40%
([http://www.climatedata.info/forcing/albedo/](http://www.climatedata.info/forcing/albedo)).

Is there ever a time when the water warms up more than the sand because
of these differences in reflectivity?Â  If one calorie of energy from
light from the Sun falls on one gram of water and all of that energy is
absorbed by the water, its temperature will go up at most 1ÂºC because
its specific heat is 1.0 cal/(gÂºC).

What happens when one calorie of energy from light from the Sun falls on
one gram of sand? If the sand absorbs all of the energy, we saw above
that its temperature goes up 5ÂºC because its specific heat is only 0.2
cal/(gÂºC).

If the sand reflects 40% of the incoming energy, however, how much does
one gram of sand's temperature go up if it receives 60% of the incoming
energy? If one gram of sand only needs 0.2 calories to increase in
temperature by one degree Celsius and it absorbs 0.2 cal + 0.2 cal + 0.2
cal = 0.6 cal, its temperature will go up 3ÂºC.

Even in this worst case, with the water absorbing the most it can and
the sand reflecting the most it can and absorbing the least it can, the
sand will increase in temperature much more than the water.Â  This
confirms that the differences in reflectivity are not very important;
what matters more is the difference in specific heats.

*(g) Considering the relative importance of various properties.*
Thinking about what properties and processes might matter during an
exploration is an important part of doing science. Figuring out which
matter more than others is useful so that one can focus on the causes of
major effects before investing a lot of time and effort in exploring
less important effects.

Students in our area of the country can go to the beach on sunny days.
The sand is warm; brrr, the water is cold! How can that be? Later in the
day, however, the sky often clouds over and a breeze comes up from over
the water. Why would that happen?

### **A. Considering the influence of the properties of materials on thermal effects** {#chapter-028-using-powerful-ideas-to-explain-intriguing-phenomena-involving-local-weather-at-the-beach.html#U3H38}

##### ***Question 3.8 Why is the sand warm and the water cool at the beach*** ***Â if the Sun has been shining on both in the same way for the same time?*** {#chapter-028-using-powerful-ideas-to-explain-intriguing-phenomena-involving-local-weather-at-the-beach.html#U3H58 style="text-align: center"}

-   Use central ideas about the properties of sand and water, such as
    their thermal conductivities, specific heats, and reflectivities, to
    explain why the sand is hot and the water cool at the beach even
    though the Sun has been shining on them in the same way for the same
    time.

#### *1. Example of student work explaining about hot sand and cool water at the beach* {#chapter-028-using-powerful-ideas-to-explain-intriguing-phenomena-involving-local-weather-at-the-beach.html#U3H49}

*At a sunny day at the beach, the top of the sand is warm. The radiation
from the Sun heats up the surface of the sand, but sand has a low
thermal conductivity, so this energy stays at the surface of the sand.
When you dig your feet into the sand it is cool below because the energy
from the Sun was not transferred below the surface of the sand.*

*Water has a higher thermal conductivity, meaning the energy from the
Sun is quickly transferred throughout the water, a big area. This means
the heat will be even throughout the water, taking a lot more energy
than is supplied to finally heat up the entire ocean. The water also
feels cool because water has a bigger specific heat than sand. Despite
the water receiving the same amount of energy for the same amount of
time as the sand, the water needs more energy to change one gram of the
water one degree Celsius. It takes 1 calorie of energy from the Sun to
change one gram of the water one degree Celsius, while sand only needs
0.2 calories of energy from the Sun to change the same amount. This
means it will take longer for the water to increase in temperature
because water needs more energy to do so.*

*Another factor contributing to water temperature is the angle of the
Sun. If the Sun is shining on the water from an angle, some of the light
is reflected. When the light is reflected the energy is not being
absorbed, so the temperature is not increasing as much. When the Sun is
high in the sky above the water, the energy will be absorbed because the
light is not being reflected.*

**B. Considering the influence of light and thermal effects on weather
at the beach**

A wonderful sunny day at the beach can turn cloudy and somewhat chilly
with a breeze coming off the water late in the afternoon. What causes
this shift in the weather?

##### ***Question 3.9 Why do clouds and sea breezes often form in the afternoon*** ***after a sunny day at the beach?*** {#chapter-028-using-powerful-ideas-to-explain-intriguing-phenomena-involving-local-weather-at-the-beach.html#U3H59 style="text-align: center"}

-   Draw a diagram that illustrates why sand is warm, water cool, clouds
    often form in the sky, and breezes blow in from the sea in the
    afternoon after a sunny day at the beach.
-   Explain these aspects of local weather at the beach in terms of
    transfer of energy processes such as radiation from the Sun,
    reflection, absorption, conduction, evaporation, condensation, and
    convection.
-   To explain a complex sequence of physical processes, start with
    radiation from the Sun and discuss each step with your group
    members. What is the influence of differences in thermal
    conductivity and specific heat between sand and water? What roles do
    conduction, evaporation, condensation, and convection play in
    setting up a circulation of air above the sand and water?
-   Monitoring what one is doing can be helpful when developing
    complicated explanations. Every so often, step back and consider:
    What are we doing? Why are we doing this? How is doing this helping
    us?

Complete your explanations before looking at an example of student work.
Next consider nuances about the influence of light and thermal phenomena
on local weather at the beach. Then enjoy reading about how three young
children learned to interpret a sea breeze diagram like the one below.

This student created a clear diagram of the convection cycle underlying
sea breezes:

FIG. 3.22. Student's diagram explaining why clouds and sea breezes often
appear in the afternoon after a sunny day at the beach.
:::
:::

The diagram is labeled *Convection Cycle* and as a *diagram illustrating
explanation for sea breezes.* The student drew and labeled a *Sun* whose
rays shine on both the land and sea, *heating* the *sand* and water. The
warm sand warms the air above by *conduction*, and the *heating air
rises*, represented by the gray upward arrow.Â  Some water evaporates
forming *cool moist air* above the water, which blows toward the shore
forming a sea breeze, represented by the gray arrow toward land. A cloud
forms in which *Condensation into cloud* occurs as moisture in the warm
moist air condenses in the cooler upper atmosphere. The *cooling air
sinks*, represented by the gray arrows to become *cool moist air* over
the water, which then blows toward shore, represented by the gray arrow
toward the land.

The student interpreted the diagram as follows:

*As we have learned in the past few weeks, light leaves a source such as
the Sun and travels in all directions, (including) to the sand and to
the water. Sand is a poor conductor of heat so when the Sun warms the
sand, the heat is not distributed evenly, making the surface hot. Also
the specific heat of sand is lower than that of water so when both are
exposed to the same amount of light, the sand at the surface will have a
higher change in temperature.*

*Water is a good conductor of heat so the heat from the sunlight is
evenly distributed throughout the water. Also water has a higher
specific heat than sand so it will not warm as much when exposed to the
same light.*

*Over the water, some of the light energy is used to change the state of
some water, evaporating it into a gas state. This makes the air over the
water cooler moist air.*

*The air above the sand continues to heat, because the sand heats at a
higher rate than the water. As the air (above the sand) warms, it rises.
The cool moist air above the water begins to move toward the sand,
(forming the sea breeze).*

*The hot sand heats the cool moist air in a process called conduction,
causing the air to rise, (cool), and the gaseous water to form a cloud
through condensation. As the air cools, it sinks back toward the water.
As the warm and cool air moves, it is called "convection."*

#### *2. Nuances about explaining changes in the weather during a sunny day at the beach* {#chapter-028-using-powerful-ideas-to-explain-intriguing-phenomena-involving-local-weather-at-the-beach.html#U3H411}

There are many sea breeze diagrams available on the Internet. Some are
quite detailed, such as
<http://www.yachtingmonthly.com/sailing-skills/understand-sea-breeze-49027>
). This is intended for people interested in sailing in coastal waters.
Some diagrams show land breezes that occur at night as well as sea
breezes that occur during the day, such as
<http://climate.ncsu.edu/edu/Breezes> . This website refers to
differences in air pressure that are related to changes in the density
of air. As the land warms by energy radiated from the Sun, the air
immediately above it also warms by *conduction*; as the warm air
expands, it become less dense than the cool air above it and the warm
air rises. This forms a low pressure region over the land. The cool
moist air over the water is more dense. This forms a high-pressure
region over the water. The cool moist air then flows toward the land,
which forms the sea breeze. As this moist air warms over the warm land
by conduction, it also expands and rises. This sets up a *convection*
current of warm moist air rising and cool air flowing from the ocean
over the land up into the upper atmosphere and back down to the water.
The upper atmosphere is cool and as the rising warm moist air cools, the
moisture *condenses* into tiny droplets of water, forming clouds. This
complex cycle is an example of the interactions of several of Earth's
systems, the geosphere (rock, soil, and sediments including sand),
hydrosphere (water in the ocean and atmosphere), and atmosphere (air
over both land and sea).

#### *3. Example of learning and teaching about sea breezes with friends and/or family members* {#chapter-028-using-powerful-ideas-to-explain-intriguing-phenomena-involving-local-weather-at-the-beach.html#U3H412}

##### ***Question 3.10 What happens when teaching friends or family members about the physical phenomena underlying changes in the weather at the beach?*** {#chapter-028-using-powerful-ideas-to-explain-intriguing-phenomena-involving-local-weather-at-the-beach.html#U3H510 style="text-align: center"}

The student who drew the diagram in Fig. 3.22 chose to discuss sea
breezes with three children for whom she baby sat: Lucie-7, Ava-4 and
Ruby-4:

*I did this project with some of the children I babysit, Lucie, Ava, and
Ruby. I asked the girls if they had ever heard about sea breezes and
what they think when they hear that phrase.*

*Lucie, said: "um is that like breezes from off of the sea?" Ava and
Ruby asked: "is that like when you can see the wind moving leaves and
stuff?" I then showed the girls a diagram of sea breezes and asked them
their initial thoughts.*

*Mind you the girls are 4 and 7 so the answers I got are interesting.*

*Me: Which do you think is warmer when you go to the beach, the water or
the sand?*

*R: "The sand!"*

*A: "The water..... I mean the sand!"*

*L: " the sand, cause sometimes the sand is super hot and burn-y and you
have to dig down to where it isn't as hot."*

*Me: Okay so do you think the air above the water is warmer or colder
than the air above the sand?*

*Â L: "The air above the sand is probably warmer, cause it is being
warmed up by the sand."*

*Me: Okay good. Does warm air sink or rise do you know?*

*A:" Um, I think warm air rises."*

*Me: Why?*

*A: " Well cause in our room during the summer it was always way hotter
on my top bunk than it was on Ruby's bottom bunk. And it was way hotter
at the top of the house than in the downstairs and dad said its cause
hot air likes to go up."*

*Me: That's really good thinking Ava. So do you think that the warm air
at the beach warms and rises too?*

*A: "Well yeah probably."*

*Me: Okay so say there is wind that comes and blows the air above the
sea over to the sand, what would happen?*

*L: "well the air would get warmer, cause it would be with the warm
sand. Then it would rise up like the hot air in the house does."*

*Me: Ruby can you show me on the diagram where you think this is
happening?*

*Ruby pointed to where the arrow points up on the diagram and goes
towards the cloud.*

*R: Right here is where it is happening. It goes up and into a cloud.*

*Me: Good job Ruby. Okay so when the hot air goes up something called
condensation happens, which is like when you have a cold water bottle
and the water drops collect on the outside of the bottle. This is
because the water inside the bottle is colder than the water in the air
outside the bottle. This is also how clouds form. The different air
temperatures mix and the water drops form into a cloud because a cloud
is actually a mist and a lot of water drops. Now on the diagram what
looks like it happens to the cloud?*

*L: The cloud goes back out to the ocean.*

*Me: Okay and as the air goes back to the ocean it gets colder, what
happens to colder air?*

*Â R:Â  Colder air goes down!*

*Me: Good job Ruby, Ava can you point to where the colder air is going
down?*

*Ava pointed to the arrow of cold air descending back to the top of the
water.*

*Me: Okay now what do you think will happen to the air when it gets back
above the water?*

*L: I think it will keep going in this circle like the diagram says.
Cause it will get pushed by sea breezes; then it will get all hot again
over the sand. And that will make it rise up into the air and be a
cloud. Then it will get pushed back out to sea and sink again when it
gets cold. And start again and again.*

*One thing that I think Lucie in particular learned about was patterns,
which described by the article are: "Patterns. Observed patterns of
forms and events guide organization and classification, and they prompt
questions about relationships and the factors that influence them."
Lucie was able to say that she thought that the air would continue in a
cycle and would follow the sea breeze cycle in a pattern that the cold
air would always sink and the hot air would always rise.*

*I also think that the girls participated in engaging in argument from
evidence. When Ava explained to me why she thought that the hot air
would rise she used evidence she had from her own life to explain what
she thought would be true. She was engaged in forming an argument, and
backing it up with what she already knew.*

*Also the girls worked on asking question and on finding a good way to
answer the questions that I proposed to them, to think about what the
other girls had said, and to make a guess or to answer with that in
mind.*

*I also learned that I am not completely comfortable explaining this
phenomena, mostly because I am not sure that I fully understand how this
cycle is taking place yet so I was not sure how to phrase questions. I
also didn't do the best job of having the girls try and figure out the
diagram on their own. This is something for me to work on in the future
when I work with other students.*

In our area, going to the beach involves being aware of and prepared for
the possibility of a tsunami occurring. A tsunami is a large wall of
water that may flood a beach and surrounding areas because of an
earthquake. Geologists have used mathematics and knowledge of physical
phenomena to build complex computer models for predicting earthquakes
and tsunamis.

### **A. Exploring computer models designed to predict earthquakes and tsunamis** {#chapter-029-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-a-quantity-of-interest-2.html#U3H310}

A major 9.0 earthquake may occur, for example, off the coast of northern
California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia. This region is
called the Cascadia Subduction Zone (see
<http://www.oregon.gov/oem/hazardsprep/Pages/Cascadia-Subduction-Zone.aspx>
). This fault line is about 600 miles long and lies under the Pacific
Ocean about 70 to 100 miles beyond the shoreline. If there is a major
earthquake along this fault line, a tsunami wave that comes ashore is
predicted to be up to 100 feet high.

##### ***Question 3.11 How do geologists predict earthquakes and tsunamis?*** {#chapter-029-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-a-quantity-of-interest-2.html#U3H511 style="text-align: center"}

The Earth's surface is broken up into *tectonic plates,
(<https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Plate-Tectonics/Chap2-What-is-a-Plate>* ).
A *subduction* zone is a region in which one plate moves underneath
another. The cause of multiple earthquakes in the Pacific Northwest
region is attributed to movement of the Juan de Fuca oceanic plate under
the North American plate as shown in Fig. 3.23.

When one tectonic plate presses against another, pressure builds up
until motion occurs; the earthquake releases energy that travels outward
through the Earth as *seismic waves*
(<http://www.geo.mtu.edu/UPSeis/waves.html> ). The primary waves, known
as p-waves, are compression waves that travel quickly through the Earth
as shown in Fig. 3.24. P-waves move the earth back and forth in the
direction of motion. Secondary waves, known as s-waves, are like water
waves, they move the earth up and down, or side to side, as shown in
Fig. 3.24.

    earthquake: Use a SlinkyÂ® .]{style="border: 1pt solid black"}
-   To model p- waves, each pair holds the end of a SlinkyÂ® with the
    SlinkyÂ® stretched out along the floor. One gives the SlinkyÂ® a hard
    push toward the other.
-   Next model s-waves. One person gives the SlinkyÂ® a quick jerk side
    to side. If the pair are standing up, jerk the SlinkyÂ® up and down.

If such an earthquake happens off the Pacific Northwest coast, a series
of large ocean waves, up to 100 feet high, may quickly flood coastal
areas in 15 to 20 minutes (see:
[http://www.oregongeology.org/tsuclearinghouse/](http://www.oregongeology.org/tsuclearinghouse)
). These huge waves are called tsunamis. Tsunamis might also originate
in distant earthquakes occurring under the ocean elsewhere, with perhaps
several hours warning. Signs in tsunami zones alert residents and
visitors with a visual display of the danger as shown in Fig. 3.25.

The predicted safe areas are green, the areas likely to be inundated by
a local tsunami are yellow, and those likely to be inundated not only by
a local tsunami but also by a distant tsunami from an earthquake far
away from the Oregon coast are orange. An A on the green area of the map
indicates a designated assembly area in the event of an evacuation.

Steps to be prepared include making a disaster plan, preparing supplies
in case of a disaster, protecting yourself during an earthquake,
evacuating if necessary, and following your plan (see:
<http://www.oregongeology.org/tsuclearinghouse/steps-visitors.htm#prepare>
). Â Although an enticing very low shore may occur just before and after
a large wave, it is important to head immediately away from the beach as
more very large waves may follow.

Preparation includes assembling a 'Go-Bag' to keep in your car in case
of a disaster (see:
(<https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/em8864.pdf>
). Suggested items include water (1 gallon per person per day), 3-day
supply of non-perishable food, first aid kit, non-prescription drugs,
tools and supplies, sanitation items, entertainment (games, books),
clothing and bedding, special requirements, and important family
documents.

#### *1. Examples of student reflections upon discussing earthquake and tsunami preparedness* *with a friend or family member* {#chapter-029-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-a-quantity-of-interest-2.html#U3H413}

A guest, Douglas Lownsbery, facilitated a class session in which he
provided information and set up four centers about earthquakes and
tsunamis: a set of items for students to choose within 10 seconds which
they would put in a "go bag," a large plastic container with sand,
water, and toy people and houses with which to model a tsunami
occurring, a long slinkyÂ® to model p- and s-waves, and a core sample
that he had prepared with 5th graders at a local beach, that included
evidence of a previous tsunami in our area. After the session, the
students wrote about their experiences discussing earthquake and tsunami
preparation with a friend or family member. A student provided the
reference for an article and a reflection on a conversation with a
roommate:

[ *The New Yorker Magazine, How to Stay Safe When the Big One Comes*
[*http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-to-stay-safe-when-the-big-one-comesÂ .*](http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/how-to-stay-safe-when-the-big-one-comes.)
]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

[ *My "learner" this week was one of my roommates. I had her read over
the article that I had chosen from the New Yorker and we had quite a big
discussion about it. We talked about how we and no one we know bolt
things down in our homes for safety. We also do not have a kit to be
prepared for a tsunami or an earthquake.* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

[ *After talking about the article, I started talking about how we
should all have "go bags."Â Many of us do not think that this would
affect us, but it could happen at any time we are near the coast and it
is best to be prepared to help yourself and to help others. We were
wondering what exactly we SHOULD put in our go bag because that was not
extremely clear when we were learning about it in class. The city of
Seaside Oregon has a "go bag" section on their website. They recommend
that you pack:* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

-   [ *First Aid kit,* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *prescriptions and non-prescription medication*
    ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Water bottle and treatment supplies capable of providing 1 gallon
    per person per day* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Non-perishable food* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Cooking and eating utensils, can opener, cook stove.*
    ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Waterproof matches, lighter or flint* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Shelter (tent, tarp or poncho)* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Emergency blanket* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Portable NOAA weather radio* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Flashlight or headlamp, and extra batteries*
    ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Warm clothing* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Personal hygiene items (toilet paper, soap, toothbrush)*
    ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Tools and supplies (pocket knife,
    [shut-off]{style="color: #2d3b45"} wrench, duct tape, gloves,
    whistle, plastic bags)* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}
-   [ *Cash* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

[ *This did not include things like rope or an emergency blanket, but a
"go bag" can be different for everybody. The important part is that we
always have one in our car.* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

[ *We talked a lot about cause and effect. When an earthquake hits-what
do we do? What happens next? When can you tell a tsunami is about to
hit? Where should you go when it is hitting? What happens to houses and
people that are not in the safe zone? What does a town look like after a
tsunami hits? How far away from the coast can a tsunami travel?*
]{style="color: #2d3b45"}\
[ *The cause: the earthquake/tsunami* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}\
[ *The effect: how it effects people and towns*
]{style="color: #2d3b45"}\
[ *In doing this we used the science and engineering practice of asking
questions and defining problems. This was an easy one to cover because
we do not know much about tsunamis and earthquakes because this area
does not seem to be worried about them even though we should be.*
]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

[Another student talked with a family member who lives in a tsunami
evacuation zone]{style="color: #333300"}

<div>

[ *I decided to engage my mom in learning about earthquakes and
tsunamis. I chose to talk to her about this topic because she lives on
the coast and will directly be impacted by the earthquake and tsunami
that are due to occur anytime soon. I have noticed that many people are
aware of the fact that Oregon is expecting a natural disaster in the
near future but no one has done anything to prepare for this.*
]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

[ *I first began by asking my mom what she knew about earthquakes and
what she has done so far to prepare for an earthquake and tsunami. She
knew a lot of facts about earthquakes along with understanding the
scientific reasoning for why tsunamis happen but unfortunately she has
not done anything to prepare.* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

[ *I took this time to pull up the elevation map that was shown in class
to show the best places to run to during a tsunami. While looking at
this map we both realized that our house is in a zone that is expected
to be under water in the event of a tsunami.* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

[ *"I am not even sure what I would put in a go bag if I needed to make
one." stated my mother. I took this opportunity to talk to her about the
activity we did in class where we had 10 seconds to pack 10 items in a
bag. I told her about some of the items I put in the bag and why I put
these things in. She asked what types of food would be best to start
stocking up on.* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

[ *I told my mom the story about the little girl named Tilly that saved
not only her family but also other people while on vacation in Thailand.
Since my mom is a fourth grade teacher I told her the importance of
talking about this topic with her students. She understood and agreed
with me and said she wants to start talking about earthquakes and
tsunamis more in her classroom.* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

[ *...We also talked about evacuation routes, plans, and communication.
My mom made the decision to continue this investigation by researching
different ways to educate her students on the importance of being
prepared during this type of event. The crosscutting concept that we
used during this discussion was cause and effect. We talked about
earthquakes and tsunamis and the impact it would have on our family
physically, mentally, and emotionally.* ]{style="color: #2d3b45"}

An emphasis on how to prepare helps to mitigate the fear that one may
experience in realizing what might happen should a major earthquake
occur.

Many US states have adopted the *Next Generation Science Standards*
(NGSS, Lead States, 2013). In addition to science and engineering
practices and crosscutting concepts, this document recommends
disciplinary core ideas that student should learn at various grade
levels.
:::

### **A. Learning about the USÂ *Next Generation Science Standards: Disciplinary Core Ideas*** {#chapter-030-making-connections-to-educational-policies.html#U2H314 style="text-align: center"}

::: {.bc-section .section}
##### ***Question 3.13 What NGSS science and engineering practices, crosscutting concepts and disciplinary core ideas have you used in developing an explanation for theÂ occurrence of hot sand, cool water, clouds, and sea breezes late in the afternoon after a sunny day at the beach?*** {#chapter-030-making-connections-to-educational-policies.html#U3H513 style="text-align: center"}

The *Next Generation Science Standards* describesÂ *disciplinary core
ideas* in terms of *learning progressions (*NGSS, Lead States, 2013,
Appendix E) (See:
*<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices>*.) These
indicate what students should learn about a topic in Kindergarten-2nd
grade, 3rd-5th grade, 6th-8th grade and 9th-12th grade.

Disciplinary core ideas inÂ physical science, for example, include:

***PS3.B Conservation of energy and energy transfer:***

-   -   During Kindergarten-2nd grade, students should learn that
        s*unlight warms Earth's surface.*
    -   During 3rd-5th grade, students should learn that e*nergy can be
        converted from one form to another form.*
    -   During 6th-8th grade, students should learn that t*he
        relationship between the temperature and the total energy of a
        system depends on the types, states, and amounts of matter.*
    -   During 9th-12th grade, students should learn that t*he total
        energy within a system is conserved.Â *

-   How are these disciplinary core ideas relevant to the development of
    an explanation for sea breezes?

-   Provide an example of how the explanation of sea breezes
    incorporates one or more of the eight NGSS science and engineering
    practices: asking questions and defining problems; developing and
    using models; planning and carrying out investigations; analyzing
    and interpreting data; using mathematics and computational thinking;
    constructing explanations and designing solutions; engaging in
    argument from evidence; and obtaining, evaluating, and communicating
    information.

-   Provide an example of how the explanation of sea breezes
    incorporates one or more of the seven NGSS crosscutting concepts:
    patterns; cause and effect; scale, proportion, and quantity; systems
    and system models; energy and matter: flows, cycles, and
    conservation; structure and function; and stability and change.

The disciplinary core ideas, science and engineering practices, and
crosscutting concepts are called *dimensions* of science learning and
teaching. It is important to consider all three dimensions when
designing learning experiences in science contexts.

**B. Reflecting upon this development of a complex explanation**

Explaining sea breezes is complicated. Â As the conversation with Ava
above illustrates, however, even four-year-old children know that "hot
air rises" and can support that claim with evidence "in our room during
the summer it was always way hotter on my top bunk than it was on Ruby's
bottom bunk. And it was way hotter at the top of the house than in the
downstairs..." This four-year-old already has understood the essence of
the nature of science, being able to make an argument based on evidence.
Young children are capable of scientific reasoning in contexts with
which they are familiar and have had relevant experiences upon which to
draw in making sense of what they are learning.

What happens when energy radiated from the Sun shines on sand and water
at a beach in the same way for the same time? A more complex version of
Ava's scientific reasoning occurs in making an argument about what
happens when different materials absorb incoming energy. One way to
explore this question is to create a model of the situation in the
laboratory. What happens when energy radiated from a lamp shines on
equal masses of sand and water in the same way for the same time?

[The graphs in Fig. 3.17 and 3.19, for example, demonstrate a major
difference in that the temperature versus time line for the sand was
clearly steeper than the line for the water.
]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"}[Â This replicates the
effects seen at the beach, that equalÂ ]{style="font-size: 1em"}input[Â of
energy results in very difference changes in temperature for sand and
water. Using specific heat information from outside sources indicated
that the s*pecific heat* of sand was about 0.2 calories of energy to
change the temperature of one gram by one degree C whereas the specific
heat of water was by 1.0 calories of energy to change the temperature of
one gram by one degree C..Â ]{style="font-size: 1em"}[This difference in
the property ofÂ specific heat, *inÂ *how much energy is needed to change
the temperature of one gram of a material by one degree
Celsius]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"}[, is the key to
explaining why sand at the beach is hot and the water cool even though
the sun has been shining on both in the same way for the same time.
]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"}

[Differences in other properties, such
asÂ ]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"} *thermalÂ *
*conductivity* [and]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"}
*reflectivity,Â * [also contribute to causing this effect.
]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"} [The temperature near the
bottom of the cup of sand was lower than the temperature near the
surface, whereas the temperature of the cup of water was the same
throughout. This indicates that the sand had a low thermal conductivity.
This means]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"} [Â that the
incoming energy absorbed by the sand stayed near the surface, warming
the surface sand whereas the incoming energy absorbed by the water on
the surface flowed throughout the cup of water. Using reflectivity data
from outside sources also demonstrated that reflectivity effects were
minor compared to the big difference in effect due to the property of
specific heat.]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"}

Tracing the flow of energy in a system also is useful in understanding
what is happening. As shown in Fig. 3.14, convection occurs when a
circular current forms as warm fluid rises and cold fluid sinks.
Similarly, as energy flows from the warm sand to the dry air above it by
conduction, the less dense warm air rises; as energy flows from the warm
air into the cooler upper atmosphere, the cooling air becomes more
dense, and sinks back down toward the surface, setting up a convection
current. Meanwhile some of the liquid water absorbs enough energy from
the sun to evaporate into theÂ cool air above the water's surface. As the
warm air rises above the hot sand, the cool moist air above the surface
of the water blows toward shore, forming a sea breeze. When the moist
air warms, Â rises, and cools in the upper atmosphere, the moisture
condenses back into liquid water droplets and forms clouds.

Developing this complex explanation of local weather that students have
experienced at the beach seems to be motivating. Several have identified
this session as a highlight of the course. The pleasure students seem to
experience in this accomplishment may help them to appreciate the hard
work of figuring something out as well as understanding the emotional
satisfaction that scientists derive from their studies.

One goal of this course has been to build confidence in using the tools
of science, particularly graphs and diagrams. Creating a graph of data
and telling the 'story' that the graph displays can be a powerful skill
to have, both professionally and personally. Also powerful is the
ability to create and use diagrams that visually explain whatever needs
explaining. In addition, the process of articulating what was done,
found, and understood in this complex context can help students gain
confidence as science writers, able to set forth their own ideas and
reasoning in clear and coherent ways.

### **C. Making connections to NGSS understandings about the nature of science**

This unit provides a good example of the NGSS science and engineering
practice of *constructing explanations*as well as the crosscutting
concept of *cause and effect* in focusing upon the difference in the
property of specific heat for sand and water. The very low specific heat
of sand compared to that of water causes large differences in increases
in temperature when light from the Sun shines on sand and water in the
same way for the same time. This is an example of aspects that students
in grades 3-5 should learn to do, toÂ *identify the evidence that
supports particular points in an explanation.* They also should
understand that *the transfer of energy can be tracked as energy flows
through a designed or natural systemÂ *while they are learning
disciplinary core ideas about the *conservation of energyÂ *and energy
transfer.

Unit 3 also has provided additional examples of the nature of science
such as thatÂ *science knowledge assumes an order and consistency in
natural systems (*NGSS Appendix H
<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices> .Â This unit
assumes, for example, that what happens with small amounts of sand and
water warmed by a lamp in the laboratory is consistent with what happens
with large amounts of sand and water at a beach. Also assumed is that
similar mechanisms cause the apparent paradox that the sand is very hot
but the water is cool even though the Sun is shining on both in the same
way. The students explored possible causes for these different effects
by considering the role of differences in three properties of sand and
water: their reflectivities, thermal conductivities, and specific heats.
TheyÂ [observed differences in how much the temperatures changes on the
surface when energy flowed from a lamp placed equal distances from cups
of sand and water.]{style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em"}

The process of explaining why the sand is hot but the water cool as well
as why sea breezes and cloudy skies often appear in the afternoon after
a sunny day at the beach was a culmination of the earlier explorations
of the nature of light and thermal phenomena.Â Students may gain from
this exploration some understandings about how scientific knowledge
grows and connects in multiple ways across many contexts. The process of
engaging friends and family members in learning about sea breezes at the
beach also may help convey some of these understandings about the nature
of science to others.

The theme for this course is: *What happens when light from the Sun
shines on the Earth?* In this unit, you will be exploring the effect of
light from the Sun on the Earth's atmosphere, land, and oceans. In
particular, you will be developing additional central ideas about light
and thermal phenomena as well as considering ways that energy from the
Sun enters and leaves the Earth. While exploring these phenomena, you
will be:

-   ***identifying resources*** such as what you already know about
    aspects relevant to global climate change

-   ***developing additional central ideas based on evidence*** about
    models of light and thermal phenomena

-   ***explaining intriguing phenomena*** such as the greenhouse effect
    and rising sea levels

-   ***developing mathematical representations*** of changing quantities
    such as the rate of change in the mass of melting glaciers

-   ***using mathematical representations to estimate a quantity of
    interest*** such as predictions about the likelihood of flooding at
    particular locations and

-   ***making connections to educational policy***, such as theÂ *Next
    Generation Science Standards* (NGSS Lead States, 2013), the science
    standards adopted by many US departments of education.

This unit continues your exploration of learning processes as well as of
physical phenomena.Â  The main sections present questions with
suggestions for exploring topics and for writing reflections about your
findings. Text in gray font indicates that these are suggestions; you
may think of other ways to explore the topic. Asking your own questions
as well as those posed here will enhance learning both about physics and
about learning. Check with your instructor if you choose to devise an
alternative approach.

Â Small groups will be exploring various phenomena in class. Keeping
track of what one is doing and thinking is important. In this course,
use a template for a physics notebook page on which to record your notes
during class. The physics notebook page can help you remember your
thoughts *before, during,* and *after* an exploration. An experienced
elementary teacher, Adam Devittt, designed this notebook page to mirror
the structure of *before, during,* and *after*Â reading strategies:

[Before]{style="text-decoration: underline"} starting your exploration,
think about and discuss with your group members what you know already
about this topic, how you plan to conduct the exploration, and what you
think you might find out.

[During]{style="text-decoration: underline"} your exploration, record
what is happening, what you are observing, and what you are thinking
about what you are observing. Include sketches of equipment and
observations. Note any words that are new and their definitions.

[After]{style="text-decoration: underline"} your exploration, record any
central ideas that have emerged from your observations and discussions.
Also note the evidence on which you have based these ideas. State
explicitly how the evidence is relevant and supports the claims you are
making in stating these ideas. Also explain why this result is
important. Then write a reflection about whatever you want to remember
about this experience. In addition, briefly state what you are still
wondering in this context.

In summarizing and reflecting upon your explorations, you also will be
integrating science and literacy learning. This includes learning to
speak clearly, listen closely, write coherently, read with
comprehension, and create and critique media.

After writing your own summary of your findings, read some examples of
student work. The student authors first wrote drafts, received feedback
for ways to enhance content and clarity, and submitted these final
versions. Also read about some nuances to consider when explaining the
phenomena explored. You should read both of these sections of the text
to be sure you have understood both the physics and the learning
processes involved.

Also available are students' reflections about teaching a friend or
family member about what they have just learned in class. Some
additional sections present historical information about ways knowledge
about the topic developed. In addition, some reflect upon relevant
aspects of the nature of science in the context of the topic explored.
Read these sections to broaden your understanding of science and of
science learning and teaching.

In this section you will considerÂ a local example of the influence of
light and thermal phenomena on a closed system. You also will be
documenting some what you already know about aspects of global climate
change.
:::

::: {.bc-section .section}
### **A. Connecting to relevant everyday experiences** {#chapter-033-identifying-student-resources-4.html#U4H32}

A phenomenon that you may have experienced occurs when light from Sun
shines into an enclosed area.

##### ***Question 4.1 What happens when a closed car is parked in the Sun on a sunny day?*** {#chapter-033-identifying-student-resources-4.html#U4H52 style="text-align: center"}

-   Discuss with your group members experiences you may have had in
    getting into cars that have been parked with the windows up on a
    sunny day. Why do you think that happens?

This is an example of a system in which more energy enters than leaves
the system. Although the mechanisms differ, the result, an increase in
temperature inside the car, is similar to what seems to be happening to
the global climate here on Earth.

### **B. Documenting initial knowledge about aspects of global climate.** {#chapter-033-identifying-student-resources-4.html#U4H31}

##### ***Question 4.2 What do you already know*** ***about the influence of light and thermal phenomena on global climate?*** {#chapter-033-identifying-student-resources-4.html#U4H51 style="text-align: center"}

Document your initial knowledge about the influence of light and thermal
phenomena on global climate by responding to the following *diagnostic
questions.* These diagnostic questions focus upon two aspects of changes
in global climate: the greenhouse effect and rising sea levels. Your
responses will not be graded. You will answer the same questions again
near the end of the unit, compare initial and current responses, and
write a reflection about changes in understandings and ways these
occurred.

Â When light from the Sun shines on a person, the person feels warmer;
when light from the Sun shines on a closed car, the seats, dashboard,
steeling wheel, and air inside the car get warmer; when light from the
Sun shines on a greenhouse in a garden, the plants, soil, and air inside
the greenhouse get warmer.

What happens when light from the Sun shines on the atmosphere, land, and
oceans of the Earth? Discussions about a warming Earth often refer to
the *greenhouse effect*. To understand what is happening in the
greenhouse effect on the entire Earth, we first need to review some of
the central ideas developed in earlier units and to develop some
additional central ideas about light and thermal phenomena.

### **A. Developing additional central ideas about light phenomena** {#chapter-034-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-4.html#U4H33 style="text-align: center"}

Unit 1 developed the central idea that light can be envisioned as rays
traveling in straight lines. As shown in Fig. 4.1, this was useful in
drawing ray diagrams to explain the upside-down projection in a pinhole
camera. Such ray diagrams also were useful to explain the apparent rise
of a dot on the inside of a cup when the cup is filled with water as
well as the appearance of rainbows in the sky.

Sometimes sunlight shining through clouds looks like rays of light,
often informally called sunbeams and known as *crepuscular rays*
(<http://www.atoptics.co.uk/atoptics/ray1.htm>). Children typically draw
pictures of a sun with bright rays shining out in all directions.
However, can you actually *see* rays of light traveling from various
objects straight to your eyes?

##### ***Question 4.3 Are rays of light visible or invisible?*** {#chapter-034-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-4.html#U4H53 style="text-align: center"}

-   Discuss with your group members in what sense you think light rays
    are visible or not.

When a driver sees a traffic light turn bright green, light must be
traveling from the bulb to the driver's eyes but the light rays'
journeys are not visible. Are there other experiences in which you can
detect something even though its journey is not visible? When standing
near an oven, for example, you can see the oven but how do you know
whether the oven is "on" or not?

##### ***Question 4.4 What is "invisible light"?*** {#chapter-034-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-4.html#U4H54 style="text-align: center"}

If you are standing near an oven that is cooking dinner, you likely are
aware the oven is on because you can feel its warmth. How is that energy
getting to you? The oven is radiating energy even though you cannot see
that energy is leaving the oven and traveling to your body. This process
is called energy transfer by *thermal radiation.* You too are warm and
radiating energy!

Equipment: If you have access to a thermal camera or to a computer with
a "thermal camera" effect:

-   What do think you will see? Which areas of your face, for example,
    might appear to be brighter than other areas when viewed through a
    thermal camera?

All objects radiate energy. Thermal cameras detect thermal radiation and
represent it on the camera screen with varying levels of brightness that
indicate varying levels of temperature as shown in Fig. 4.2.

Sometimes called *night-vision cameras*, thermal cameras are helpful for
"seeing" warm bodies in the dark or in smoky settings such as houses on
fire. Thermal cameras have many uses in safety, law enforcement,
healthcare, electronics, and maintenance. For information about various
ways to use such cameras, search the Internet for "uses of thermal
cameras" and view a website such as
<https://reductionrevolution.com.au/blogs/news-reviews/69333381-over-60-unexpected-uses-of-infrared-thermal-imaging-camera-images>
.

Thermal radiation also is known as *infrared radiation*. Some telescopes
can "see" infrared radiation emitted by astronomical phenomena. Visible
light images and infrared images look very different, as shown in Fig.
4.3. Both of these images are of the constellation known as Orion, the
Hunter (<https://in-the-sky.org/data/constellation.php?id=61>). This
constellation is visible in both northern and southern hemisphere skies.

On the left image, the light green lines connect the stars outlining the
envisioned hunter's shoulders, belt, and knees; a sword seems to hang
below the belt. Within the blade of the hockey-stick figure is a giant
cloud of dust, gas, and young stars known as the Orion nebula. This
region of active star formation may be faintly visible on a clear dark
night away from city lights. (See:
<https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-42-the-orion-nebula>).
The constellation's dusty clouds are vividly visible, however, in the
infrared image on the right.

Infrared radiation is part of the *electromagnetic spectrum*. Your eyes
cannot see infrared radiation but your skin can detect it as warmth.
Light that you can see when light shines onto the retinas of your eyes
is called *visible light* and consists of white light and its component
colors. As shown in Fig. 4.4, however, visible light is only a small
part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

:::
:::

Although the names used in the electromagnetic spectrum refer both to
rays (infrared radiation, ultra violet radiation, x-rays, gamma rays)
and to waves (microwaves, radio waves), all of these forms of light can
be described as waves, with varying wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 4.4.
They also have varying frequencies, the number of waves that pass a
point each second.

Fig. 4.5 illustrates the meaning of *wavelength*, the distance from one
crest to the next, from one midpoint to the next, or from one trough to
the next of a wave. The Greek letter lambda, Î», is typically used as the
symbol to represent wavelength.

Forms of light with larger wavelengths than visible light are known as
*infrared radiation*, *microwaves*, andÂ *radio waves.* Forms of light
with smaller wavelengths than visible light are known as *ultra violet
radiation*, *x-rays*, and *gamma rays*. Radio waves have the largest
wavelengths but the lowest frequencies and lowest energies. Gamma rays
have the smallest wavelengths but the highest frequencies and energies.

Exploring the wave model of light

Equipment: Use a SlinkyÂ® Â for each pair of students
:::

-   Each pair holds an end of a SlinkyÂ® with the SlinkyÂ® stretched out
    along the floor. What happens when one person gives the SlinkyÂ® a
    quick jerk side to side? These waves are similar to the s-waves that
    travel through the earth during an earthquake (see Fig. 3.24 in Unit
    3).
-   For more information about the electromagnetic spectrum, search on
    the Internet and read one of the many relevant websites, such as
    <http://earthsky.org/space/what-is-the-electromagnetic-spectrum> and

-   To learn more about infrared radiation, watchÂ *Infrared: More Than
    Your Eyes Can SeeÂ *(6:45 min)**,Â **with astrophysicist Dr. Michelle
    Thaller, from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope,
    atÂ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2--0q0XlQJ0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2--0q0XlQJ0).
    Watch carefully what happens when Dr. Thaller demonstrates
    differences in the way that different materials transmit white light
    and infrared radiation:
    -   What happens when she puts her hands inside a black plastic bag
        when viewed with a regular camera? With an infrared camera?
    -   What happens when she brings a clear pane of glass near her face
        when viewed with a regular camera? With an infrared camera?

The clear glass pane and black plastic bag differ in the property
ofÂ *transmissivity*, how they transmit different forms of light. The
black plastic bag transmits infrared but not visible light. This clear
pane of glass transmits visible light but not infrared.

Â 
:::

::: {.bc-section .section}
Two related properties are *absorptivity,* how well a material absorbs
light, and *emissivity*, how well the material emits light. [Materials
that absorb energy from visible light, emit infrared radiation as they
warm up]{style="text-decoration: underline"}.Â Another property of
materials is known as *reflectivity,* how well a material reflects
light. This property was explored in Unit 1, VII.A.Question 1.20. All of
these properties of materials affect what happens when light from the
Sun shines on the Earth. Also relevant is the composition of light from
the Sun: about 44.7% of solar energy is in the visible range, about
48.7% is in the near-infrared, and about 6.6% is ultraviolet (See:
<https://coolcalifornia.arb.ca.gov/science-of-cool-roofs> )Â

phenomena on global climate

*Many of us have experienced the heat of the sun, as light shines on
Earth and heats up the surface. We have noticed that sidewalks are hot
on a sunny day, and that a car with the windows rolled up is hotter than
a car with the windows rolled down.*

*Table (IV.1) features ideas explored in this lab about the influence of
light and thermal phenomena on global climate.*

FIG. 4.6 A student's entries for Table IV.1.
:::
:::

In row 1, the student drew a picture of a wave and a half wave and
identified a wave length as extending from one crest to the next.\
In row 2, the student drew a person with arrows representing infrared
radiation emitted from the person's body.\
In row 3, the student drew a black plastic bag and wrote *goes through
plastic;* the student also drew a glass pane and wrote *doesn't go
through glass.*

The student wrote the following rationales for the ideas claimed in the
third column of the table:

***Visible light can be represented as a wave and is part of a broad
spectrum of such waves.*** *In this lab we stretched our perception of
light, envisioning it as moving in waves. The wave still travels in a
straight line, which is the midpoint of the wave. The distance between
each crest is the wavelength. The height of a wave is called amplitude,
and frequency is how often the wave crest passes a point each second.
Light waves emitted by the sun come in various wavelengths, which create
the electromagnetic spectrum. Waves are classified by their wavelengths.
The shortest waves are gamma rays, then x-rays, then UV rays. The
visible light is what the human eye can see. The next largest wavelength
is microwaves, and then radio waves have the largest wavelength on the
spectrum.Â *

***Hot objects emit energy as infrared radiation.*** *Dr. Michelle
Thaller,
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2--0q0XlQJ0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2--0q0XlQJ0),
introduces the idea that, "Everything in the universe emits some kind of
light." Infrared radiation is a kind of light wave that is not visible
to the human eye. Dr. Thaller provides many examples of infrared
cameras, which measure the energy being emitted by an object, or
temperature. Warmer objects look bright in infrared, because they are
giving off more infrared radiation. Colder objects look dark because
they are giving off less infrared radiation.*

***Materials differ in whether visible light and infrared radiation can
pass through the material or are blocked.*** *Dr. Michelle Thaller
introduces the idea that visible light and infrared light pass through
and are blocked by different materials. Infrared radiation can often
pass through things that visual light cannot, such as a black plastic
bag. Infrared also gets stopped by something visible light gets through,
such as clear glass.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

The history of the development of knowledge about various forms of
"invisible light" is an example of the way that science develops, with
participation and different points of view expressed and explored by a
variety of individuals in many countries over several centuries (1600 to
present day). To broaden your understanding, read about the discovery of
infrared radiation as well as discoveries of the other forms of
invisible light in the electromagnetic spectrum. The following two
sections (III.A.2 and 3) provide a glimpse of this journey if the reader
has time and interest. Otherwise proceed to Section III.B below.

#### *2. Discovery of infrared radiation* {#chapter-034-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-4.html#U4H43 style="text-align: left"}

In 1672, in England, Sir Isaac Newton published in the *Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society of London* a paper about his new
theory about light and colors. He explained in detail his many
experiments with white light and its component colors in a book,
*Opticks,* published in 1704. About a century later, an astronomer in
England, Sir William Herschel (1800 a, b, c, d) reported his discovery
of the *invisible rays of the Sun* in a series of papers he also
published in the *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of
London.*

What did Herschel mean by the "invisible rays of the Sun"? He was
interested in the Sun as well as in the stars. To study the Sun during
the day, he used different colored filters on his telescope to reduce
the sunlight's intensity. Some colored filters seemed to warm his eye
more than others and he became curious about this uncomfortable effect.

To explore how the different colors in the spectrum warmed a material,
Herschel placed a prism in a window and oriented it to make a spectrum
of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet light shine on a table.
As Newton had observed about 100 years earlier, the red light rays were
bent the least by the prism and violet the most (see Unit 1, IX).
Herschel, however, was asking a different question, about how light of
different colors warmed materials.

As shown in Fig. 4.7, Herschel used three thermometers: thermometer \#1
measured changes in temperature when its bulb was placed within a band
of color in the spectrum on the table; thermometers \#2 and \#3 served
as controls when placed nearby but outside the spectrum.

Herschel was surprised that thermometer (\#1) warmed up when he placed
it just beyond the red band of the visible spectrum. It warmed even
though no light appeared to be shining on it! Like Newton, Herschel
referred to the refraction of light rays by the prism as
*refrangibility*. After reporting details of his experimental setup and
data collected, Herschel concluded:

Â 

*The first four experiments prove that there are rays coming from the
sun, which are less refrangible than any of those that affect the sight.
They are invested with a high power of heating bodies, but with none of
illuminating objects; and this explains the reason why they have
hitherto escaped unnoticed.*

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â 
Â  Â Herschel, 1800b, p. 290

These were *invisiblerays of the Sun* because they could heat an object
without appearing to shine on the object, illuminating it. These
invisible rays were bent by the prism less than any of the colored rays,
landing on the apparatus just beyond the red band of the visible
spectrum.

Herschel also demonstrated that these invisible rays exhibited the same
laws of reflection and refraction that were well known for white and
colored light. He also studied similar effects for *terrestrial rays*
such as from fires whose embers were no longer red hot but still warmed
thermometers placed nearby.

This was the discovery of what is known as *infrared radiation*, energy
that warms materials but does not make them visible to human eyes. This
is an example of an unexpected finding during an exploration motivated
by a practical need: Herschel wanted to understand why filters of
different colors warmed his eye differently when he was looking at the
Sun through his telescope. He was surprised when he noticed the
increased temperature of the thermometer placed beyond the red band of
the spectrum.

Herschel also had placed a thermometer beyond the violet band of the
spectrum. Seeing little if any temperature change, however, he had
concluded, "I was now sufficiently persuaded that no rays which might
fall beyond the violet, could have any perceptible power, either of
illuminating or heating" (Herschel, 1800b, p. 288).

-   One way to explore infrared radiation is to replicate Herschel's
    experiment. See, for
    example,Â <http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/classroom_activities/herschel_example.html>.
    This experiment uses a glass prism, several identical thermometers,
    a way to hold the prism still, a white sheet of paper, a box, and a
    sunny day.

    introduction to infrared radiation and a demonstration of this
    experiment.

    Planetarium, has described "the brilliant way that infrared light
    was discovered" at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr4qEhcGPq8>.

Herschel and his sister Caroline became world famous for their surveys
of the skies with telescopes made and used in their home. Among Caroline
Herschel's achievements were the discovery of three nebulae and eight
comets as well as development of an extensive catalogue of stars and
nebulae
(<https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/in-caroline-herschels-footsteps>;
<https://www.noao.edu/image_gallery/html/im1017.html>). In 1828, she was
the first woman to be awarded a Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical
Society
(<https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Herschel/Caroline_and_William_Herschel_Revealing_the_invisible>).

#### *3. Discoveries of the other invisible portions* *of the electromagnetic spectrum* {#chapter-034-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-4.html#U4H44 style="text-align: left"}

Discovery of the rest of the invisible portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum occurred during the next hundred years, 1800-1900. A German
scientist, Johann Wilhelm Ritter, was aware of Herschel's discovery of
invisible rays beyond the red band in the spectrum of visible light and
decided to check for himself whether there were invisible rays beyond
the violet band.

Ritter had been experimenting with a chemical, silver chloride, that
darkened when placed in sunlight. In 1801 he found that this chemical
reacted very little when placed in the red band of the spectrum,
darkened when placed in the blue band, and reacted intensely when placed
beyond the violet band in the spectrum, demonstrating the presence of an
invisible form of light there also. He attributed this effect to
*chemical rays,* which later were called *ultraviolet radiation (*see:
<https://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/U/Ultraviolet> .)

A hundred years earlier, Newton and Huygens had disagreed about whether
light should be envisioned as rays, made up of particles traveling in
straight lines, or as waves, traveling in spreading circles. This
discussion continued with Herschel writing in terms of rays and a
contemporary, Thomas Young, writing in terms of waves.

Herschel described his findings in terms of *invisible rays* of the Sun
that were reflected and refracted in the same way as white light and the
colors of the visible spectrum. Young, however, envisioned light as
*undulations* that spread out from a source in expanding waves, like
sound waves and water waves when a pebble is dropped in a puddle. In an
article published in 1802 in the *Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society of London,* Young used a wave model of light to explain
findings from a double-slit experiment, in which light passing through
two slits created interference patterns on a screen (see:
[http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/interference/doubleslit/](http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/primer/java/interference/doubleslit).)

More than sixty years passed before a Scottish scientist, James Clerk
Maxwell predicted the existence of other forms of electromagnetic waves
in his theoretical article, *A dynamical theory of the electromagnetic
field,* published in 1865 in the *Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society of London* (see:
<https://science.hq.nasa.gov/kids/imagers/ems/consider.html> ).

In 1888, a German scientist, Heinrich Hertz, designed ways to produce
and study radio waves and microwaves experimentally
(<http://www.sparkmuseum.com/BOOK_HERTZ.HTM>). \[Percy Spencer, an
American scientist, invented the microwave oven in 1946 after noticing
that something had melted in his pocket one day as he was working on
improving radar technology
([http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a19567/how-the-microwave-was-invented-by-accident/](http://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/gadgets/a19567/how-the-microwave-was-invented-by-accident)
.\]

A German scientist, William Roentgen, received the first Noble Prize in
Physics, in 1901, for discovering X-rays in 1895. He named these new
puzzling rays after the "x" representing unknowns in mathematics
(<https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1901/rontgen-bio.html>)

A French scientist, Paul Villard, discovered gamma rays in 1900. Gamma
rays are generated by radioactive atoms
(<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s000160050028>). Â He was
using a radioactive sample he had been given by a Paris colleague, Marie
Curie. She won the Nobel Prize twice, in 1903 and 1911, for her studies
of radioactivity
<https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/marie-curie-facts.html>
)

The issue of *what IS light* continued to be discussed during the 20th
century: is light a series of spreading waves or is light a stream of
particles moving in straight lines? In 1905, Albert Einstein wrote:

*Indeed, it seems to be that...the production or conversion of light can
be understood better if one assumes that the energy of light is
discontinuously distributed in space. According to the assumption to be
contemplated here, when a light ray is spreading from a point, the
energy is not distributed continuously over ever-increasing spaces, but
consists of a finite number of energy quanta that are localized in
points in space, move without dividing, and can be absorbed or generated
only as a whole.*

production and transformation of light. *Annelen der Physik 17:*

(<http://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol2-trans/101> ) Princeton
University Press.

Einstein received the Nobel Prize in 1922 for this paper, in which he
explained the photoelectric effect in terms of particles of light, now
known as photons. A series of Nobel Prizes were awarded during the 20th
century for theorists and experimentalists exploring the wave and
particle natures of both light and matter as inferred in the context of
quantum mechanics. See

Professor Lisa Randall
(<https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/randall>), a
theoretical physicist at Harvard University, has written about the
wave-particle duality in terms of the level at which one is looking,
whether one is using one's eyes looking at everyday things or "looking"
at an atomic level where quantum mechanical effects occur. The phrase
*classical* refers to physics understandings in the everyday world. The
phrase *quantum mechanical* refers to physics understandings at the
level of and within atoms and molecules.

*...none of us (with the possible exception of superheroes) sees
individual photons, so quantum mechanical effects cannot be easily
detected. Ordinary light doesn't look as if it's made up of quanta. We
see bunches of photons that constitute visible light. The large number
of photons together act as a classical wave.*

*You need a very weak source of photons, or a very carefully prepared
system, to observe the quantized nature of light. When there are too
many photons, you can't distinguish the effect of any single one. Adding
one more photon to classical light, which contains many photons, just
doesn't make a big enough difference. If your lightbulb, which behaves
classically, emitted one additional photon, you would never notice. You
can observe detailed quantum phenomena only in carefully prepared
systems.*

### **B. Reviewing central ideas about thermal phenomena developed in earlier units** {#chapter-034-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-4.html#U4H34}

Units 2 and 3 developed some central ideas about how energy flows from
one place to another. These ideas are relevant in exploring what happens
when light from the Sun shines on the Earth.

##### ***Question 4.5 How does energy flow from one place to another?*** {#chapter-034-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-4.html#U4H55 style="text-align: center"}

Energy transfer processes include transmission, reflection, absorption,
emission, conduction, convection, melting, freezing, sublimation,
transpiration, evaporation, and condensation. Properties of materials
such as specific heat, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity also
affect what happens when energy flows from one place to another such as
on a sunny day at the beach when the sand is hot, the water cool, and a
cloudy sky as well as sea breezes often occur in the afternoon (Unit 3,
V. Questions 3.8 and 3.9). Tracing the flow of energy in this scenario
involved interpreting a diagram as shown in Fig. 3.9 and repeated as
Fig. 4.8 below.

FIG. 4.8 Student diagram for explaining sea breezes.
:::
:::

The explanation of sea breezes included the following story about how
energy flows from the Sun and circulates around the sand, water, and
atmospheric system during a sunny day at the beach:

The Sun *radiates* energy to the Earth.\
Some of the energy is *reflected* by the sand and the water\
Some of the energy is *absorbed* by the sand and the water.

Sand and water differ in the property of *specific heat*. One gram of
water needs about five times as much energy as one gram of sand to
change temperature by one degree C. This means that if equal masses of
sand and water absorb the same amount of energy, the sand's temperature
will increase about 5 times as much as the water's temperature
increases.

Sand and water also differ in the property of *thermal conductivity.*
Sand's thermal conductivity is low; this means that energy absorbed by
the sand stays near the surface of the sand; sand below the surface
remains cool. Water's thermal conductivity is high; this means that
energy absorbed by the water at the surface spreads throughout the
water; water below the surface warms along with the water at the
surface.

Because energy absorbed stays near the surface of the sand and less
energy is needed to increase the sand's temperature, sand gets hot.
Because energy absorbed spreads throughout the water and more energy is
needed to increase the water's temperature, the water stays cool even
though the sun has been shining on both sand and water in the same way
for the same time.

Sand and water also differ in the property of reflectivity. Sand
reflects up to 40% of incoming sunlight depending upon its composition
whereas liquid water reflects only about 6% unless the Sun is close to
the horizon. However, this difference is masked by the large difference
in specific heats. Even if a gram of water absorbed an entire calorie of
energy from the sun and a gram of sand reflected 40% of a calorie of
energy from the sun, the sand would still warm up three times as much as
the water.

Also some of the water evaporates into the air above the surface of the
water. Evaporation uses energy to change water from a liquid to a
gaseous form, so the energy from some of the light from the Sun shining
on the water goes into this process rather than into warming the water.

Energy flows from hot objects to cold objects. When the objects are
touching this process is called *energy transfer by conduction.* The hot
sand warms the cool air above it by conduction.

Fluids expand when warmed. The warmed air, becoming less dense, rises
into the cooler upper atmosphere; the warmed air cools as its energy
flows into the cooler surrounding air; cool more dense air sinks back
toward the surface. This process is called *energy transfer by
convection.*

As the warm air rises, moist cool air over the water forms a sea breeze
by flowing toward the land. The hot sand warms the moist air; the warmed
moist air becomes less dense and rises into the cooler upper atmosphere;
the warmed moist air cools as its energy flows into the cooler
surrounding air; as the moist air cools, the moisture condenses into
water droplets, forming clouds; this releases some energy into the upper
atmosphere as the water changes back from a gaseous to liquid form; this
energy may get dissipated during storms as wind, thunder, and lighting;
the cool more dense air sinks back toward the surface.

This complex process of tracing the energy from the Sun as it flows from
one place to another is useful preparation for thinking about happens
when the Sun shines not only on the sand and water at a beach but on the
entire Earth.

##### ***Question 4.6*** ***What is the role of systems thinking in understanding the Earth's energy budget?*** {#chapter-034-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-4.html#U4H56 style="text-align: center"}

In Unit 2, Question 2.10, it was important to think about the *system*
involved when comparing the ratio of masses of hot and cold water to the
ratio of their changes in temperature when mixed together. Was all the
energy lost by the hot water flowing into the cold water or was some
energy flowing into the containers or nearby air? To completely account
for all of the energy lost by the hot water, one needed to think what
was happening to the energy in the entire system, not only in the cups
of hot and cold water but also in their surroundings.

In this unit, the system of interest includes the entire Earth. What is
happening to the energy that the Sun is radiating to the Earth? Is the
amount of energy radiated to Earth from the Sun also the same as the
amount of energy flowing away from the Earth into space? The balance
between energy flowing in and out is referred to as the Earth's *energy
budget* in analogy to a financial budget that monitors the balance
between income and expenses.

For a system to be in thermal equilibrium, the amount of energy leaving
the system must equal the amount of energy entering the system. This
central idea underlies the influence of light and thermal phenomena on
global climate and in particular, the phenomenon known as the greenhouse
effect.

FIG. 4.9 A student's entries to Table IV.1 (continued)
:::
:::

In the first row, the student drew a picture of a hand touching a block
(from Unit 2,III,A,Question 2.2) and wrote *From our touch*: The student
also drew a picture of a light bulb and wrote *From another source*. The
student also wrote, *Energy transfer occurs through touch, and through
emission.*

In the second row, the student drew a half circle representing *Earth*
and an arrow pointing *in* from the *Sun,* represented with a small
circle, as well as an arrow pointing *out* from the large half circle
representing Earth.

The student wrote the following rationales for the central ideas claimed
in the third column of the table:

***Energy transfer occurs through a variety of processes.** Energy from
the Sun is transferred through radiation -- light rays traveling to an
object -- like sand, and transferring the energy, heating the sand.
Reflection can block some energy from being transferred, such as the
ocean reflecting radiation when the Sun is at an angle. The sand on the
beach absorbs the Sun's energy all along the top layer of the sand,
heating it. Infrared radiation is emitted from warm objects, such as a
person's hand. An infrared camera can detect and display warm and cold
regions based on the emission of infrared radiation. Conduction
transfers energy through direct contact, such as a warm hand on a piece
of metal. Convection is the energy transfer that can occur in fluids,
when a heat source heats an area of water... The warm water rises and
travels towards the cooler area, and the cool water sinks and travels
towards the warmer area...An example of a change in state of water due
to energy is evaporation. Sometimes sunlight provides enough energy for
some of the liquid water in bodies of water to evaporate.*

***The Earth's energy budget is the flow of incoming and outgoing
energy.*** *Â  Through the processes of radiation, reflection, and
absorption, energy enters and exits Earth's atmosphere. For a stable
environment, Earth's incoming energy should be equal to Earth's outgoing
energy. If the budget is not balanced, the temperature within Earth's
atmosphere, oceans and land forms will change.Â  If the incoming energy
is greater than the outgoing energy, then the temperature will rise.Â  If
the outgoing energy is greater than the incoming energy, then the
temperature will decrease. For stabile temperatures on Earth, the
incoming and outgoing energy should be equal.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

These central ideas about energy transfer processes and the concept of
the Earth's energy budget are key for understanding the greenhouse
effect within the Earth's climate system.

The greenhouse effect is often mentioned in discussions about global
climate. The name of this effect refers to an analogy between what
happens when the Sun shines on the entire Earth and what happens when
the Sun shines on a greenhouse in a garden here on Earth.

### **A. Considering what happens during the greenhouse effect in a garden greenhouse** {#chapter-035-using-powerful-ideas-about-light-and-thermal-phenomena-to-explain-the-greenhouse-effect.html#U4H35}

A student noted that sometimes people have no idea what is happening in
a greenhouse here on Earth:

*I asked my sister if she knew anything about the greenhouse effect and
she said nothing.So I asked if she ever heard of it before and she said
no. Then I reminded her that greenhouses are used for gardens. She went
'Oh, right' but didn't know what they did for the gardens*...

Physics 111 Student, Spring 2016

Therefore it can be helpful to start this discussion with a focus on
greenhouses in gardens here on Earth

The student labeled two *lamps* shining on two *clear plastic tubs*.
Both tubs had *wet paper towel*s in the bottom and *temperature probe*s
*on ruler*s leaning on one edge of the tub, with the ruler resting on
the bottom. One tub had *plastic wrap* covering the top of the tub.

**Â ** *Two plastic tubs were set up under lamps with a wet paper towel
in each.Â  Both tubs also had a temperature probe attached to a ruler so
we could track any changes in temperature that may have occurred.Â  One
tub had plastic wrap covering the opening, and the other had no
covering.Â  We predicted what would happen, and many of us thought that
the one with plastic would be warmer, since heat could not escape as
easily as the tub without plastic wrap.Â  At the beginning of this
experiment both temperatures were about 22Â°C.Â  Later in the lab we
returned to these tubs to see that the tub with plastic wrap had
condensation on the plastic, and was much warmer than the other tub.Â  At
the end of this experiment, the tub without plastic was 27.9Â° and the
tub with the plastic wrap was 35.7Â°C.Â  Both tubs had an increase in
temperature as a result of heat from the lamp.Â  However, with the
plastic wrap blocking heat (energy) from leaving the tub, it was much
hotter than the tub without a blocked exit.Â  Like this model, if
greenhouse gasses block energy from leaving the Earth, then Earth's
temperature will drastically increase.*

Physics student, Spring 2016

The greenhouse effect in this model of greenhouses in gardens involves
an enclosed container getting warmer when more energy from the light
source enters than leaves the container. The warmed air in the open
container can circulate outside the container so the open container does
not warm as much as the covered container.

Enclosed greenhouses in gardens prevent warmed air from circulating with
cooler air outside. In addition, the garden greenhouse may be made out
of glass that transmits visible light but not infrared light. Although
the plants use some of the energy they absorb to grow, they also emit
infrared radiation as they warm, as do the other contents of the
greenhouse such as the soil, tables, and tools. If the infrared
radiation cannot travel out through the glass and remains within the
greenhouse, the temperature of the contents and the air increases. This
mechanism differs from what happens when light from the Sun shines on
the entire Earth, but the overall effect, an increase in temperature
because of energy that does not leave the system, is the same.

If more energy enters than leaves, a system warms up. Within a garden
greenhouse, the owner can use vents to modulate the energy flow in and
out if the greenhouse gets too hot (see, for example,
[https://www.advancingalternatives.com/blog/getting-started-greenhouse-ventilation-systems/.](https://www.advancingalternatives.com/blog/getting-started-greenhouse-ventilation-systems)
Â With a greenhouse effect operating within the entire Earth, however,
what can the Earth's "owners" do if the Earth gets too hot? That is the
issue that concerns scientists and others convinced on the basis of

To consider the *greenhouse effectÂ *in the context of the entire
Earth,Â each group will need: Â a large white board as well as a white
board marker and eraser for each student.
:::

-   With your group members, talk about the greenhouse effect on a
    global scale.
-   On a large white board, draw a diagram to represent your group's
    initial ideas about what is happening to the energy that enters the
    Earth's system when light from the Sun shines on the Earth:
    -   Where does this energy go?
    -   What changes does it undergo while on Earth?
    -   How does it leave the Earth?

```{=html}

```
-   Plan and practice briefly what each group member will say when
    presenting your group's diagram to the whole group.
-   Share your ideas and their representation on a whiteboard with the
    whole group:
    -   What patterns do you notice in these presentations?
    -   How are the groups' ideas similar? How are they different?
    -   How do they help you think about the greenhouse effect on the
        Earth?

#### *1. Â Examples of students' initial diagrams about the greenhouse effect* {#chapter-035-using-powerful-ideas-about-light-and-thermal-phenomena-to-explain-the-greenhouse-effect.html#U4H47}

As shown in Fig. 4.12, Group 3's diagram portrays the basic idea of the
greenhouse effect, that *thermal energy* travels in rays from the Sun to
the surface of the Earth and some of this *thermal energy* travels back
out from the surface through the *atmosphere* to space. Some *energy*
travels from the surface into the *atmosphere* but is *trapped* and
returns back to the surface. The *atmosphere* includes two gases, *water
vapor* and *carbon dioxide* that are relevant to this process.

greenhouse effect with some details. These include that rays from the
*Sunheat up* the surface of the *Earth*; that some rays cannot penetrate
the atmosphere due to water vapor; that some rays bounce back and forth
between the Earth's surface and Â clouds in the *atmosphere* (*It's a
TRAP!)*, and some rays escape out to space, which raises an interesting
question, does *light disappear??* in space because *Space is dark*. Â A
red star draws attention to the statement *light can only penetrate the
atmosphere if it is not blocked by clouds!*

As shown in Fig. 4.14, Group 2's diagram portrays the basic idea of the
greenhouse effect with some additional details. The *Sun* sends rays in
many directions, including toward *Earth*. Implied is that some of these
rays get through the *atmosphere* and interact with the surface, which
*keeps the earth warm -- also heats it up!* The surface includes our
classroom, Room *328*, within a building within our country. Three
clouds represent what happens in the *atmosphere:*Â  a *cloud, this is
also a cloud...and so is this. Just so you know* . *The water vapor
heats up -- doesn't allow the light to go through.* Â The *atmosphere
contains : gases...oxygen* and *nitrogen.Â * These students recognized
that the Sun affects *other planets* and they suggest *use your
imagination* to consider the Sun's effect there.

The students moved their chairs to form a circle and each group
presented their whiteboard to the others. These examples demonstrate
that the students already had useful knowledge about the importance of
the Sun and the atmosphere, about some of the relevant processes, and
about their effects. Many of the details needed elaboration and/or
refinement but the small groups were able to make reasonable first
attempts at creating these complex diagrams. The actions of talking with
one another in the small groups, creating their group's initial
greenhouse effect diagrams, and sharing these ideas and diagrams through
the *circle conversation* set the context for studying a controversial
and complex topic in a respectful way.

-   -   1.  *Solar radiation is emitted from the sun, headed toward
            Earth.*
        2.  *Most of the sun's radiation is absorbed by the earth's
            surface, thus warming the earth.*
        3.  *Some of the solar radiation is reflected back out to space
            by the earth surface and atmosphere.*
        4.  *As the solar radiation heats up the earth's surface and
            lower atmosphere, the radiation is converted into thermal
            energy called infrared radiation.*
        5.  *Some of the infrared radiation escapes Earth's atmosphere,
            but most of it is absorbed and re-emitted to the earth by
            the greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, warming the surface
            even more.*

*The earth should be able to keep a proper balance of energy in and
energy out in order to keep the surface temperature stable for our
current ecosystems; however this is no longer true. The earth's "energy
budget" has been disrupted by the presence of more than the natural
amount of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. Deforestation, excessive
use of fossil fuels, and massive beef consumption all are factors that
contribute to excess greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide and
methane. Infrared rays have a hard time passing though these gases in
the atmosphere, trapping more from escaping. This means that the earth
is receiving the same amount of energy from the sun as it always had,
but it is unable to release a balanced amount back out to space,
throwing off the energy budget. Unfortunately, while there are things we
as humans can do to aid in this issue, many people are not willing to
make the necessary changes in order to save the planet.*

#### *4. Nuances about the greenhouse effect and the Earth's energy budget* {#chapter-035-using-powerful-ideas-about-light-and-thermal-phenomena-to-explain-the-greenhouse-effect.html#U4H410 style="text-align: center"}

Some students are curious about what it means for the infrared radiation
to be "trapped" by the green house gases. Some have questions about the
details involved in what happens to the energy entering and leaving the
Earth's system. This section provides additional information for those
interested.

*(a) Mechanism that underlies the statement that energy is "trapped" by
greenhouse gases.* Discussions of the greenhouse effect often refer to
energy being "trapped" by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. What are
greenhouse gases and what does being "trapped" mean in this context?

The Earth's atmosphere is composed of a mixture of gaseous molecules
(see, for example, <http://climate.ncsu.edu/edu/Atmosphere>). Most of
the atmosphere consists of nitrogen molecules (N~2~) and oxygen
molecules (O~2~). These molecules transmit the sunlight shining through
them. Greenhouse gases, however, are molecules that interact with
infrared radiation from the Sun as well as with infrared radiation
emitted from the surface of the Earth. The major greenhouse gases are:

-   -   -   water vapor, formed by two atoms of hydrogen bonded to one
            atom of oxygen, H~2~O
        -   carbon dioxide, formed by one atom of carbon and two atoms
            of oxygen, CO~2~
        -   methane, formed by one atom of carbon and four atoms of
            hydrogen, CH~4~.

The greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere "trap" energy by
absorbing infrared radiation and then emitting infrared radiation in all
directions, including back toward the surface of the Earth. These gases
absorb and emit infrared radiation by vibrating in complex ways. See,
<http://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Infrared_radiation>, for
example, and <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AauIOanNaWk> for forms of
vibration in carbon dioxide molecules. A diagram of such vibrations is
shown in Fig. 4.18.

The black dot represents a carbon atom, the two clear dots represent the
oxygen atoms and the coils of springs represent the chemical bonds
holding these atoms together as one molecule. The vibrations may involve
(a) the two oxygen atoms both moving away from the carbon atom, (b) one
oxygen atom and the carbon atom moving toward each other while the other
oxygen atom moves away, or (c) the carbon atom moving one way
perpendicular to the bonds while the two oxygen atoms move in the
opposite direction.

This mechanism of the greenhouse gas molecules absorbing energy by
vibration differs from the mechanism creating the greenhouse effect in
greenhouses on earth. Green houses made out of glass panes that do not
transmit infrared radiation warm up when incoming visible light is
transmitted through the glass panes, absorbed by the contents of a
greenhouse, emitted as infrared radiation, but not transmitted back out
through the glass panes. Also, the greenhouse effect can occur simply by
enclosing a container as in the exploration described in Question 4.7.
However, the effects are the same in that the temperature of a system
increases if more energy enters a system than leaves it.

*(b)Â  Details about what happens to energy entering and leaving the
Earth's system.* Figure 4.19 presents a more detailed analysis of what
would happen to the energy radiated from the Sun to the Earth during the
greenhouse effect process if the Earth's energy budget were balanced. To
be in balance:

-   -   i.  the incoming energy at the edge of the atmosphere should
            equal the outgoing energy at the edge of the atmosphere;
        ii. the incoming energy within the atmosphere should equal the
            outgoing energy within the atmosphere and
        iii. the incoming energy absorbed by the surface of the Earth
             should equal the outgoing energy at the surface.

-   -   i.  What happens at the edge of the atmosphere if the Earth's
            system is in balance? The thick yellow ray represents the
            incoming energy from the Sun (100%). The thinner yellow ray
            at the upper left corner of the diagram represents that 29%
            of that energy would be reflected back out into space from
            clouds, the atmosphere, and the surface. The somewhat thick
            red ray near the top right of the diagram represents that
            71% of that energy would pass back out of the Earth's
            atmosphere into space. If the Earth's energy budget were in
            balance, the total incoming radiation would be balanced by
            the total outgoing radiation after reflection by the clouds,
            atmosphere and surface as well as after various absorption
            and emission processes within the atmosphere.
        ii. What happens within the atmosphere if the Earth's system is
            in balance? The thin yellow branch of the incoming ray that
            points into the atmosphere represents the 23% of the
            incoming energy absorbed by the atmosphere. Also entering
            the atmosphere are three sources from the surface:
            convection as in the sunny day at the beach (5%),
            evaporation (25%), and surface radiation (117%) for a total
            of 170%. Leaving the atmosphere is energy emitted by the
            atmosphere (50%), emitted by clouds (9%), and energy from
            the surface that gets through the "atmospheric window"
            directly out to space (12%) for a total of 71% and also
            energy emitted from greenhouse gases back in the direction
            of the surface (100%) for a total of 171%, which is balanced
            (the extra 1% probably due to rounding).
        iii. What happens at the surface of the Earth if the Earth's
             system is in balance? Incoming energy absorbed by the
             surface would be transferred to the atmosphere by several
             processes: The thin waving red ray, pointing upward,
             represents transfer of the incoming energy through
             convection (5%) in ways similar to those described in
             explaining sea breezes in Unit 3. Air warmed by the surface
             by conduction, expands, rises into the cool upper
             atmosphere, and cools as energy flows from the warm air
             into the cooler surrounding atmosphere. The red ray made
             out of horizontal segments, pointing upward, represents
             transfer of energy from the surface to the atmosphere
             through evaporation (25%) such as from puddles, streams,
             oceans and through transpiration by plants. When moist air
             is warmed, rises, and cools, the gaseous water releases
             energy as it condenses into droplets, forming clouds. The
             thick red ray with the arrow pointing upward represents the
             transfer of energy from the surface to the atmosphere when
             the surface emits infrared radiation (117%) at a rate
             determined by its temperature. The total energy from the
             surface to the atmosphere would be 148%. Some gases such as
             water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane absorb most of the
             infrared radiation and re-emit it in all directions,
             including back down toward the surface of the Earth (100%),
             represented by the red ray with the arrow pointing
             downward. There would be a net sum of the energy emitted
             from the surface that would equal the incoming energy that
             is absorbed by the surface. Also some of the energy from
             the sun shines directly on the surface (48%) represented by
             the yellow ray pointed toward the surface. The energy
             reaching the surface (148%) would balance the energy
             leaving the surface (148%).

As the amount of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and methane gases in the
atmosphere increases, however, more infrared radiation will be absorbed,
emitted in all directions, including back toward the surface, with more
and more energy staying in the Earth's system, increasing the global
temperature of the Earth. For more information about the Earth's energy
budget, search on the Internet for "Earth's energy budget" and view, for
example, a series of pages (4-7) at
<https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/EnergyBalance/page4.php>

To deepen understanding about the influence of light and thermal
phenomena on global climate read some students' reflections about
engaging a friend in learning about the greenhouse effect.

#### *5. Â Examples of student work reflecting upon engaging a friend or family member in learning about the greenhouse effect* {#chapter-035-using-powerful-ideas-about-light-and-thermal-phenomena-to-explain-the-greenhouse-effect.html#U4H411}

The students explored websites that discuss the greenhouse effect and
selected one or more to use in engaging a friend or family member in
learning about the greenhouse effect. One student wrote:

*I chose to explore the greenhouse effect with my two friends. Prior to
exploring the website, they told me that they knew that the greenhouse
effect was related to "gases getting trapped in the atmosphere and
heating it up." The website,
<https://energyeducation.ca/encyclopedia/Greenhouse_effect>Â *Â *is
provided by Energy Education Canada. Both of them said that is was very
helpful to observe a diagram depicting the greenhouse effect, which
aided their understanding of the readings provided by the website. One
of my friends said that the thing that hindered his understanding was
that the arrow accompanying the text that reads, "Infrared radiation is
emitted by the Earth's surface," emerges from water, rather than from
land or a combination of land and water, which led him to believe that
the diagram was indicating that only water emits infrared radiation.*

*Both of them asked me what infrared radiation is, and I explained to
them that infrared emits energy in the form of heat, as well as that the
color of an object when observed through night vision goggles indicates
how much infrared radiation it emits, with objects that appear red
emitting a lot of infrared radiation, and objects that appear blue
emitting much less infrared radiation. Neither of them had prior
knowledge of infrared radiation, and they stated that this was the most
interesting thing they learned from the website. Additionally, neither
of them had ever heard the term "enhanced greenhouse effect," which is
what is referred to in discussions of the greenhouse effect and climate
change.*

*When I asked them how they felt about the potential consequences of
climate change, including rising sea levels, they both wondered if
climate change will drastically affect them personally in their
lifetime. Additionally, they wondered how much of the greenhouse effect
is due to livestock, which sparked an interesting discussion about how
many cows and chickens are on the earth, as well as how the raising and
consuming of animal products contributes to climate change. This
experience taught me that sometimes a conversation may not go the way
you expect it to, but it can still lead to beneficial discussion and
learning. I was not expecting to discuss livestock with them, but they
were very interested in the various layers of climate change, and I felt
that they gained a lot from the website and grew in their curiosity
throughout our discussion.*

*Both of my friends engaged in the NGSS Science practice of obtaining,
evaluating, and communicating information during this exploration. Not
only did they obtain information from the website that I showed them,
but when our discussion shifted toward the effect of livestock farming
on climate change, they both began to research articles on the topic,
obtained knowledge from them, and shared that knowledge to enhance our
discussion. They also engaged in the NGSS crosscutting concept of
systems and system models, as the diagram from the website helped them
to envision the system of the greenhouse effect and see how it works.*

Physics student, Winter 2018

Another student chose to talk about the greenhouse effect with her
father:

*So I did this assignment with my father. I had a feeling it would not
go well but I wanted to show him evidence of climate change. I first
started by asking him what he knew about the greenhouse effect. He said
"It causes global warming, climate change, and has something to do with
too many cows giving off ethanol into the air."Â  I then decided to show
him the NASA websiteÂ *
*[https://climate.nasa.gov/causes/](https://climate.nasa.gov/causes)
Â because it was my favorite. We looked over the website. It was easy to
navigate the website and the pictures were really helpful. The pictures
helped the most and the website even had before and after photos of bad
events around the world. We talked about the future effects of global
warming but he did not ask any questions. After we finished exploring
the website I explained the model diagram of the greenhouse effect again
and explained that humans are the real cause of this. I then asked what
my father thought about global warming. He said "the planet has always
been changing and it always will." So after showing all this proof to my
father he then says "it's propaganda." My father just nodded while
looking at the website.*

*I think my father did not have any questions because he is closed off
and does not want to hear that humans are causing the Earth to heat up
and it could harm/ is harming the environment. I went into more detail
about the greenhouse gasses being the real cause and that human activity
is the cause but he just wasn't interested. Through this experience I
think I have learned that it is hard to teach topics that people already
think they know or feel strongly one way about. No matter how much
evidence is shown. It is discouraging to think about how many people are
out there, unable to face the facts that global warming is real. The
older I get, the more I realize a lot of people do not listen to science
and just believe what they want to. For example, learning about
vaccines. It does not matter how much we show the scientific evidence of
the safety and success of vaccines, people still believe they cause
autism and make people sick.*

*The crosscutting concept of cause and effect is strongly shown in the
topic of greenhouse gasses because we are showing that human activity is
causing an effect on the Earth, causing it to warm up. One NGSS practice
used was modeling. We used the model given on the website to help
explain the greenhouse effect.*

Physics student, Winter 2018

These students had very different experiences, with a welcome sharing of
thoughts and additional learning for all concerned in the first and with
a reluctant listener not yet open to alternative points of view in the
second. Afterward, the second student raised in class the question of
what to do. This is a difficult question to which there are no easy
answers. To what extent is one willing to risk personal relationships in
discussing controversial topics? How can one convey information based on
evidence effectively? How can one keep one's own spirits up in the face
of such discouraging encounters? Our hope is that the small group
activities and whole group discussions in class will at least make
possible more positive experiences as well as increase information
getting to the reluctant listeners whose friends or relatives choose to
risk the conversation.

Science is a way of knowing that involves noticing that something is
happening, being curious about why it is happening, and asking questions
and seeking answers based on evidence, particularly if what is happening
seems threatening in some way. If the Earth is warming more quickly than
in the past, what evidence is there that this is happening?

### **A. Viewing evidence for global climate change** {#chapter-036-considering-the-evidence-for-global-climate-change.html#U4H37 style="text-align: center"}

Scientists from all over the world have collected and analyzed data that
confirm that the Earth's climate is warming more rapidly than in the
past. In order for citizens to learn about and understand what is
happening, this evidence needs to be communicated in readily understood
ways.

##### ***Question 4.9 How is the evidence for global climate change being communicated?*** {#chapter-036-considering-the-evidence-for-global-climate-change.html#U4H59 style="text-align: center"}

A variety of approaches are available. A visually compelling display may
be more persuasive than a more detailed presentation. The Internet
provides many resources suitable for different audiences such as
children, teachers, and the general public. Scientists have formed an
international community to collaborate by assembling evidence from
multiple studies and to interpret these findings for policy makers.

#### *1. Examples of efforts to create visually compelling displays* {#chapter-036-considering-the-evidence-for-global-climate-change.html#U4H412 style="text-align: center"}

Tables of data are hard to interpret. Long paragraphs reporting findings
are hard to grasp. Therefore, many presentations about climate change
include visually compelling displays of data.

What, for example, is the evidence that the mean global temperature is
rising? As shown in Fig. 4.20, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) provides a 33 second video graphic showing an
image of the globe on which changing temperatures are represented as the
colors shift from cooler (gray blue) toward warm (yellow) and then
warmer (red) as time shifts from 1880 to 2018.

FIG 4.20 *Global temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2018. NASA's

[https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/139/graphic-global-warming-from-1880-to-2018/](https://climate.nasa.gov/climate_resources/139/graphic-global-warming-from-1880-to-2018)*
:::
:::

Such video displays vividly illustrate differences across the globe in
the ways that annual mean temperatures are changing; higher mean
temperatures than normal are happening particularly in northern regions,
for example, more than elsewhere.

This display represents changes in mean temperatures in an interesting
way. Rather than the actual mean temperature for an area, this
represents the *temperature anomaly,* how much the mean temperature for
a given area differs for a specific year from normal for that area. The
*normal* is defined as the mean temperature over a span of years, in
this case the mean temperature for the span of thirty years from 1951 to
1980.

The reason scientists use anomalies rather than actual temperatures is
explained at
<https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/dyk/anomalies-vs-temperature>
. The basic idea is that the mean temperature for a year at a monitoring
station in a valley is likely to be different from the mean temperature
for the year at a monitoring station on a nearby mountain. The *changes*
in the mean temperature for both monitoring stations in this overall
area, however, are likely to be similar if the mean temperature for the
overall area is changing.

The data analyzed for 2018, for example, indicate that global mean
temperatures were 0.83Â° Celsius (1.5Â° Fahrenheit) warmer than the 1951
to 1980 global mean temperature. See <https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/4626>
for information about how worldwide temperature data are collected and
interpreted.

Another visually compelling way to present such data is to provide a
line graph. Fig. 4.21, for example, shows a line graph of global
temperature anomaly versus time for 1880 to 2018.

The key to interpreting line graphs is to ask oneself:

-   What does the horizontal axis on the graph represent?
-   What does the vertical axis represent?
-   What does the line represent?
-   What does the shape of the line imply?

The horizontal axis for Fig. 4.21, for example, represents time from
years 1880 to 2020.

The vertical axis represents the temperature anomaly in degrees Celsius,
that is, how much the global mean temperature for a specific year
differed from normal (defined here as the global mean temperature over
the thirty-year span from 1951 to 1980).

A gray dot represents the mean temperature anomaly for a specific year.

The jagged gray line represents how the mean temperature anomaly changed
year by year from 1880 to 2018.

The black line represents a mathematically "smoothed" plot of these mean
temperature anomalies from 1880 to 2018.

Years with negative mean temperature anomalies were cooler than normal
(the mean temperature during 1951 to 1980). These occurred primarily
before 1960.

Years with positive mean temperature anomalies were warmer than normal
(the mean temperature over the years during 1951-1980). These occurred
primarily after 1960.

A general interpretation of the line graph shown in Fig. 4.21 is that
globally mean temperature anomalies have been increasing in recent
years, indicating an on-going increase in the mean global temperature
beyond the normal for the years during 1951 to 1980.

Evidence presented via vivid line graphs can support arguments not only
about whether global temperatures are rising but also about probable
causes. A perspective sometimes stated, for example, is that the Earth's
climate has always been changing and therefore no action is possible or
needed. A company providing news to the business and financial
communities, www.Bloomberg.com, presents an animated graphic, *What's
Really Warming the World?* that directly confronts this perception. Go
to
[https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world)
to appreciate this effort by Eric Roston and Blacki Migliozzi to create
a visually simple yet compelling display. They based a series of line
graphs on findings from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The
scientists described their methodology for distinguishing contributions
of various possible causes of global warming in detail in a paper
published in the *Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth SystemsÂ *(Miller
et al, 2014)Â (<https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/mi08910y.html> ).

Interpret the first graph in this series:

-   What does the horizontal axis represent?
-   What does the vertical axis represent?
-   What does the black line represent?
-   What does the shape of the line imply?

Scroll down to see the subsequent graphs.

-   What do the colored lines on these graphs represent?
-   What factors do the graphs compare?
-   Which factor seems to have had the most influence on the average
    global temperature?
-   What aspects of this series of graphs make them visually compelling?

Scroll down and skim the notes about methodology. Note that the
designers of this animated graphic used the thirty years from 1880 to
1910 to calculate a *normal* to which to compare what happened each
year. They also used the term "average" when referring to the "mean"
temperature; both terms refer to the same number, the result of adding
up a series of numbers and dividing by the number of numbers. The black
line for the observed data ends at 2012. The designers of the graphic
present results from a study of climate modeling that ended in 2005 so
the colored lines for various possible causes end at 2005.

The graph of the combined effects tracks the line representing the
rising global temperature, with the greenhouse gases providing the
biggest contribution. By separating the graphs of the possible effects
and then combining them, this presentation demonstrated the correlation
of the increase in greenhouse gases with the increase in average global
temperature.

#### *2. Examples of Internet resources available to the public* {#chapter-036-considering-the-evidence-for-global-climate-change.html#U4H413 style="text-align: center"}

Many agencies have been developing and providing resources on the
Internet for learning about global climate change. A wide variety of
websites discuss, for example, the evidence that change is already
underway. These websites typically target particular audiences such as
children, teachers, the general public, and policy makers as shown in
Figs.4.22-4.30.

**Intended Audience: Children Â ** ***How do we know the climate is
changing*** *?*

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has developed
an extensive website for children: Climate Kids. The website considers:
Big Questions, Weather and Climate, Atmosphere, Water, Energy, and
Plants and Animals
(See:Â [https://climatekids.nasa.gov/climate-change-evidence/](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/climate-change-evidence)Â )

**Intended Audience: Teachers Â ** ***How can teachers engage students in
talking and writing about climate change?***

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has developed
resources for teachers to use in engaging students in learning about
climate change. See, for example, a 5th grade teacher's reflection about
her students' climate change essays (
[https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/planet-stewards/talking-about.html
)](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/planet-stewards/talking-about.html).
As shown in Fig. 4.23, the U.S. Global Change Research Program provides
regional resources for teachers about the National Climate Assessment
(NCA).

By clicking on the region in which they live, teachers can access
resources directly relevant to how global climate change may be
impacting their students' lives. A summary for the Northwest, for
example, states:

::: {.blockquote}
*Changes in the timing of streamflow reduce water supplies for competing
demands. Sea level rise, erosion, inundation, risks to infrastructure,
and increasing ocean acidity pose major threats. Increasing wildfire,
insect outbreaks, and tree diseases are causing widespread tree

**Intended Audience: General public Â *What are some indicators of
climate change?***

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has assembled an
extensive website providing information about various climate change
indicators such as changes in the oceans (see:
<https://www.epa.gov/climate-indicators/oceans>Â ). One issue, for
example, is the extent to which land has been converted to open water as
sea levels rise. As shown in Fig. 4.24, this is now occurring regularly
along the US Atlantic coast.

**Intended Audience: Policy makers: *What should policy makers know
about observed global climate changes and their causes?***
:::

::: {.bc-section .section}
:::

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(<https://www.ipcc.ch/about>) provides policy makers with regular
assessments of the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and
future risks, and options for adaptation and mitigation.Â The *IPCC 5th
Assessment Report,* for example,Â included aÂ *Synthesis Report*Â (see:
<https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf>Â 
(pp. 1-5).

This summary for policy makers was based on detailed analyses developed
by scientists from around the world. *The Physical Science Basis,Â *for
example*,* includedÂ 1409 pages prepared by Working Group
1Â *([https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1)).Â *This
groupÂ includedÂ a team of 209 coordinating-lead authors and lead authors,
50 review editors, and more than 600 contributing authors from all over
the world. Their work was reviewed by 1089 expert reviewers and 38
governments. The result was a detailed presentation of the consensus
about evidence that underlies claims made about climate change by
scientists from around the world.

Based on the consensus supported by these analyses, the *Synthesis
ReportÂ *included a Summary for Policy Makers Statement (SPM):

**SPM 1.1** **Observed changes in the climate system**

::: {.blockquote}
*Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many
of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The
atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have
diminished, and sea level has risen.* (p. 2)

#### *3. Examples of the international community of scientists presenting findings to policy makers* {#chapter-036-considering-the-evidence-for-global-climate-change.html#U4H414 style="text-align: center"}

This section considers the efforts of scientists from 195 countries to
collaborate in collecting and assessing evidence about the state of the
Earth's climate system. This is the issue that the Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up to address more than thirty
years ago, in 1988, by the World Meteorological Organization and the
United Nations.

Leading scientists from throughout the world prepare these assessments,
based on evidence published in scientific studies that have been
peer-reviewed. The reports for the fifth assessment are publically
available (see:
[https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5) ). The
sixth assessment is expected in 2022.

The IPCC *Fifth Assessment Report* has four parts:

*Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis*Â

[The *Synthesis Report* provides a series of Summary for Policy Makers
(SPM) statements.Â ]{style="font-size: 1em"}The first set of summary
statements focuses upon the evidence of changes and their causes. (Some
of these statements use the term *anthropogenic,* which refers to
something that is resulting from human activity.)
:::

**SPM 1**.Â  **Observed Changes and their Causes**

*Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent
anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse bases are the highest in history.
Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural
systems.* (p. 2)

**SPM 1.1** **Observed changes in the climate system**

*Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many
of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The
atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have
diminished, and sea level has risen.* (p. 2)

**SPM 1.2** **Causes of climate change**

*Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have increased since the
pre-industrial era, driven largely by economic and population growth,
and now are higher than ever. This has led to atmospheric concentrations
of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide that are unprecedented in
at least the last 800,000 years. Their effects, together with those of
other anthropogenic drivers, have been detected throughout the climate
system and are **extremely likely** to have been the dominant cause of
the observed warming since the mid-20th century. (emphasis in the
original)* (p. 4)

**SPM 1.3 Impacts of climate change**

*In recent decades, changes in climate have caused impacts on natural
and human systems on all continents and across the oceans. Impacts are
due to observed climate change, irrespective of its cause, indicating
the sensitivity of natural and human systems to changing climate*. (p.
6)

**SPM 1.4** **Extreme events**

*Changes in many extreme weather and climate events have been observed
since about 1950. Some of these changes have been linked to human
influences, including a decrease in cold temperature extremes, an
increase in warm temperature extremes, an increase in extreme high sea
levels and an increase in the number of heavy precipitation events in a
number of regions.* (p. 7)

Two additional sets of statements look to the future:

**SPM 2**. **Future Climate Changes, Risks and Impacts** (p. 8)\
**SPM 3**. **Future Pathways for Adaptation, Mitigation and Sustainable
Development** (p. 17)

Each *Summary for Policy Makers* statement is supported by a summary of
relevant evidence. Fig. 4.28-Fig. 4.30, for example, support SPM 1.1
*Observed changes in the climate system* by providing graphs
representing observations of global changes in temperature, sea level,
and greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere. Fig. 4.31 supports
SPM 1.2, causes related to carbon dioxide emissions from 1850 to 2012.

The details in these graphs can be perplexing. A general impression from
viewing these graphs, however, is that there has been a steady increase
recently in observations of the average global temperature, sea level,
and greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere as well as of
emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases due to human
activity. The International Panel on Climate Change's *Fifth Assessment
Report* and *Summary for Policy Makers* are complex documents prepared
by scientists for scientists and for others with a need for technical
information.

There are, however, many other sources of information prepared by
agencies and individuals attempting to communicate the central ideas to
the public. See, for example, <https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence>.

-   Complete Table IV.2 and write a brief summary about the evidence for
    an increasing average global temperature.

Evidence from multiple sources indicates that one impact of rising
global temperatures is that sea levels are increasing at a more rapid
rate than in the past. Although this is a global issue, there are many
ways that individuals can reduce their own impact on global climate
change.

### **A. Exploring the impact of global climate change on sea levels** {#chapter-037-using-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-to-consider-the-impact-of-global-climate-change.html#U4H38 style="text-align: center"}

What is the evidence that sea levels are rising? Why is this happening?
In particular, what happens when light from the Sun shines on snow and
ice on land versus in open water? What happens when light from the Sun
shines on the oceans?

##### ***Question 4.10 What evidence indicates that sea levels are rising?*** {#chapter-037-using-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-to-consider-the-impact-of-global-climate-change.html#U4H510 style="text-align: center"}

The IPCC Fifth Assessment report on *The Physical Science Basis* devoted
Chapter 13 to the topic of sea level change (pp.1137-1216).Â Figure 4.32
presents a line graph from this report. This graph represents past,
recent, and predicted global average sea levels.

-   What does the horizontal axis represent?
-   What does the vertical axis represent?
-   What do the lines represent?
-   What does the shape of the lines imply about global average sea
    level?

in vertical cores removed from peat in salt marches. The global mean sea
level at about 1700 is taken to be the zero level to which later global
mean sea levels are compared.

The global mean sea level appears to have begun rising slightly from
about 1800 to about 1900 and continued rising at an increased rate from
about 1900 to about 2000. The latter yearly mean sea levels were based
on several different tide gauge studies, represented by different color
lines, as well as from layers in cores of peat in salt marshes.

In 1993, satellite altimeter radar measurements began.
([https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/sod/lsa/SeaLevelRise/](https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/sod/lsa/SeaLevelRise)).
Such highly accurate data can provide detailed information about the
relative contributions by thermal expansion of the oceans and by melting
ice in Greenland, Antarctica, and mountain glaciers elsewhere
(<https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/science/ostscienceteam/scientistlinks/scientificinvestigations2013/cazenave>/.
Dr. Anny Cazenave was a lead author in such satellite altimeter radar
studies
([https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/spotlights/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&NewsID=349
).](https://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/newsroom/spotlights/index.cfm?FuseAction=ShowNews&NewsID=349)

The lines projecting mean sea level rise during the 21st century are
based on two computer models that differ in the predicted concentration
of carbon dioxide and depend upon actions taken, or not taken, to curb
greenhouse gas emissions. These models are called Representative
Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RCP2.6 (blue) models a scenario that
assumed reduced emissions with an increase in average global temperature
of less than 2ÂºC. RCP8.5 (red) models a scenario that assumed very high
greenhouse gas emissions.

##### ***Question 4.11 What happens when light from the Sun shines on glacial ice and snow on land or on icebergs in the ocean?*** {#chapter-037-using-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-to-consider-the-impact-of-global-climate-change.html#U4H511 style="text-align: center"}

When light from the Sun shines on the Earth, some of the light shines on
snow and ice. The light supplies energy needed to warm the Earth and to
change these solid forms of water into liquid water by melting. What
impact does this have if the melting happens to glaciers on land
compared to if the melting happens to icebergs already floating in the
oceans?

How can you model and compare what happens when ice melts on land with
what happens when ice melts in water? One way to explore this issue uses
the following equipment for each group:

-   2 trays or one large tray such as a cookie sheet
-   2 low containers such as identical frozen dinner trays
-   1 flat rock in one low container
-   As many ice cubes as possible to put on the rock and an equal number
    in the other low container
-   Enough water to fill the low containers to the brim

FIG. 4.33 *Student drawing of ice cubes melting on rock and in liquid
water.*
:::
:::

*In class we modeled the rising sea levels due to melting ice on land.
We started off with two bowls, each with a clean tray under it. One bowl
was empty and one had several rocks in it to act as land on Earth. We
placed the same amount of ice cubes in each bowl. In the empty bowl, we
placed the ice cubes on the bottom. In tray B we placed the ice on top
of the rocks. We then filled each tray to the brim with room temperature
water, then waited. My table predicted that the tray without the rocks
in it would not overflow because the ice already displaced the water
with enough room for it when it melted. We also predicted that the bowl
with the ice on the rocks would overflow because the ice was not already
in the water and wasn't able to displace enough room for it when it
melted. After an ample amount of time for the ice to melt, we came over
and made our final observations. As we predicted, the bowl containing
rocks had overflowed, whereas the tray without rocks did not. If you had
a glass of ice water, when the ice melts, the glass doesn't overflow,
but if you add ice to an already full glass of water, it will overflow.
This is the same for the melting land ice flowing into the ocean vs. the
sea ice already floating in the ocean. This means that the melting sea
ice does not contribute to the rising sea levels, whereas the melting
land ice does.*

*Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  National Geographic states some grim possible outcomes to
rising sea levels. If we continue down the same path we are on, we could
see the sea levels rise as much as 6.5 feet by the year 2100. It could
be made even worse if we experience the complete melting of the
Greenland ice sheet. This could push sea levels to rise to 23 feet,
which is, horrifyingly, enough to submerge London:

Figure 4.34 shows the equipment used in this exploration. An improvement
would be to use food coloring in the water so that the overflow in the
tray with the ice cubes on a rock would be more visible.

Students have periodically responded to a series of questions designed
to elicit their thoughts about what is working well and what might
improve their learning experiences in this course. A student wrote:

*I thought that the activity that had the most powerful impact on my
learning experience of global climate change was the activity about how
melting ice on land is affecting rising sea levels. I thought it was a
very simple, and straightforward way to model what is happening on our
earth.Â *

*I also enjoyed talking with my friend about the material that we went
over. She is getting her degree in environmental studies with a focus on
atmospheric science so it was interesting to hear her thoughts on what
we were learning. She also found the way we were going about
understanding the material as a way to help adults understand it as
well. Many people don't have basic knowledge of what global climate
change is so she saw the activities and lecture material that we went
over as a good way to help the general population who is unaware of
current environmental issues become educated.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â *

Physics student, Spring 2015

In a conversation about the course, this student emphasized the
importance of the use of simple equipment with which people are familiar
and are likely to have at home that makes it easy to engage a friend or
family member in thinking together about highly politicized issues like
climate change.

***Modeling rising sea levels due to thermal expansion of oceans.*** *In
class we held thermometers in our hands to warm them and model the
thermal expansion of oceans. The thermometers all began at room
temperature, and then we heated them up by placing them in our hands. As
our body temperature heated up the liquid inside, it caused the liquid
to expand and rise up though the thermometer. This taught us that not
only are oceans rising due to melting land ice, but also as the infrared
radiation heats the ocean up more and more, it is beginning to expand.
As the water in the oceans expands it rises, contributing to the rising
sea level issue. BitsofScience.org discusses more scientific findings
about the expansion of oceans in contribution to the rising sea levels.
They also mention how the expansion of the water is easier to observe
and predicate as it has less uncertainty than the melting ice caps:

that may occur if surges from higher sea levels increase areas that
become flooded:\

Such experiences and predictions of repeats of such storms underlie the
concerns being expressed that individuals, communities, and governments
must to do whatever possible to reduce the causes of climate change.

##### ***Question 4.13 What can you do to reduce your impact on global climate change?*** {#chapter-037-using-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-to-consider-the-impact-of-global-climate-change.html#U4H513 style="text-align: center"}

Many of us are unaware of the connection between what seems like a small
act on our part and its consequences on the amount of greenhouse gases
emitted into the atmosphere.

Going on an errand when the need arises, for example, seems like a
reasonable thing to do in order to make progress on the endeavor for
which the need has become apparent. One sometimes makes a judgment,
however: Is the time and effort to make a special trip worth it? If the
trip involves driving a car, also consider: How much gasoline will the
car use? According to the Energy Policy Initiatives Center of the
University of San Diego School of Law, each gallon of gasoline releases
about 19 pounds of carbon dioxide when burned. Each carbon atom in the
gasoline combines with two atoms of oxygen in the air, so the product, a
molecule of carbon dioxide, is much heavier than the carbon atom alone.
If a typical fill-up is 18 gallons, then every fill-up of the tank is
pumping about 340 pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere!
([https://epicenergyblog.com/2013/05/24/how-many-pounds-of-carbon-dioxide-co2-does-a-gallon-of-gasoline-produce/](https://epicenergyblog.com/2013/05/24/how-many-pounds-of-carbon-dioxide-co2-does-a-gallon-of-gasoline-produce)).

The University of Michigan Center for Sustainable Systems provides a
comprehensive fact sheet about sources of greenhouse gas emissions due
to everyday activities involving food, household appliances, and
personal transportation. This fact sheet also provides suggestions for
shifting to more sustainable actions
(<http://css.umich.edu/factsheets/carbon-footprint-factsheet>):

Each mile driven by the typical passenger car, for example, puts 0.8
pounds of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere so walk, bike, carpool, or
use mass transit whenever possible.

Washing laundry in cold rather than hot water can reduce carbon dioxide
emissions by up to almost 15 pounds per load, depending upon the source
of energy, temperature of the hot water, and type of washing machine.

As shown in Fig. 4.38, choosing what to eat for dinner can make a
difference in the amount of carbon dioxide emitted in producing the
different types of food eaten.

greenhouse gas emissions for different fresh food categories.*Â *Journal
of Cleaner Production.* 2016. DOI: 10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.082, Table
4.

Such comparisons are complex. Clune, Crossin, and Verghese (2016) have
compared the mass of carbon-dioxide emitted from producing a given
amount of various foods. Producing a kilogram of vegetables, fruit, or
cereals, for example, results in much smaller emissions of carbon
dioxide compared with producing a kilogram of lamb or beef meat.

::: {.bc-section .section}
Related information from a recent news item provides a vivid comparison
of the number of people an acre of land can feed depending upon the kind
of food that is grown there: Willie Riggs, director of Oregon State
University Klamath Basin Research and Extension Center, told
commissioners that an acre of wheat feeds 44 people per year; an acre of
potatoes feeds 1,355 people per year; an acre feeding dairy cows
provides enough milk for around 40,000 half-pint servings; and an acre
feeding cows raised for meat feeds around eight people per year.

If the increase in carbon dioxide emissions is causing the increase in
global temperature and you want to try to decrease your own *carbon
footprint*, how can you do that? There are several online carbon
footprint calculators that can help estimate how many *Earths* would be
needed if everyone lived like you do.

-   Work on one or more of these carbon footprint calculators on your
    computer, discuss your findings with group members, and present some
    thoughts about these findings on a white board to discuss with the
    whole group.

#### *1. Examples of student work reflecting upon engaging a friend or family member* *in learning about living in more sustainable ways* {#chapter-037-using-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-to-consider-the-impact-of-global-climate-change.html#U4H417}

A student chose to discuss with her mother some personal changes one can
make:

*For this assignment I decided to talk to my mom about global climate
change. She remains the most skeptical person in my life when it comes
to climate instability so I decided that she would be the most effective
person to talk to. She is always asking "Okay so this is a problem but
what the heck am I supposed to do about it?" We went to the
websiteÂ <https://www.nrdc.org/stories/how-you-can-stop-global-warming>
and read through the article together and I wrote down all of the ideas
about how to slow global warming that were provided. After we looked
through all of the ideas, I asked her what she thought she could do in
her life. She said that she could reduce the waste with groceries,
unplug devices, buy better light bulbs, and reduce water waste. She said
that she was amazed because she thought that in order to help reduce
global warming she would have to raise millions of dollars or buy a new
house. She had no idea that she could make small changes in her life.
During this conversation she was able to "evaluate and communicate
information" which is one of the NGSS Science and Engineering Practices.
She was presented with this information and then she communicated to me
how she believes that she will be able to make a change in her life. She
also touched on the NGSS Crosscutting concept of "cause and effect"
because we talked about how little changes that we make can have a
combined positive effect on the environment*.

Another student was able to use a carbon footprint website with a middle
school friend:

[*h*
*ttps://www.earthday.org/take-action/footprint-calculator/*](https://www.earthday.org/take-action/footprint-calculator)

*I chose to use this footprint calculator to engage my mom's friend's
daughter, S. She is in middle school and knows all about carbon
footprints and CO* ~*2*~ *emissions. I chose this website because I
thought it was a fun activity and it shows how individuals are impacting
the Earth. I asked S all of the questions on the survey. Since she does
not drive or travel often, most of her impact came from the food she ate
which she was very surprised at. She asked, "But I don't have a car, and
I recycle, and always turn off the lights. Why does it still say there
would have to be 3 Earths \[if everyone lived the same way\]?" We then
researched about the huge impacts that the food industry has on the
environment. Especially the meat industry. I then told her about
"Meatless Mondays" which we talked about in class and she was still so
surprised at the fact that meat and packaged food had such a negative
effect on the Earth. The footprint calculator was a really fun activity
and gives you a lot of scary information, such as an "Earth Overshoot
Date." But it does not really show you ways you can reduce your impact
on the Earth. I think users would benefit much more if there were a few
tips at the end of the test.*

*I would say the NGSS Science and Engineering Practice that best fits
this website is Analyzing and Interpreting Data. The footprint
calculator asks for the data on your life, like how far you drive or use
public transportation. It then uses that data to tell you how much of
Earth's resources you are using as an individual. The NGSS Crosscutting
Concept that fits this site is definitely Cause and Effect. You enter in
all of the ways you use the Earth's resources and see how it directly
affects the Earth's productivity.*

*After looking at the footprint calculator with S,Â I started to wonder
how I could teach my students about their ecological footprint without
making them feel bad about the way they live. I know I felt really
guilty when I took this test the first time.Â *

The world is full of changing quantities. Key to becoming aware of what
is happening is measuring how much a quantity is changing. That
knowledge can provide the basis for thinking about what might be
happening next and perhaps for perceiving ways to increase positive
outcomes or at least minimize negative ones.

This section develops a mathematical way of representing changing
quantities. The first activity explores changing quantities in an
everyday context, a tossed ball. The next presents evidence for a
changing quantity relevant to global climate change and its impact,
estimates of how fast glaciers are melting. Development of an analogy
between motion and melting graphs guides making projections for how fast
glacial ice may be melting in the future.

### **A. Developing familiarity with motion graphs for a tossed ball** {#chapter-038-developing-mathematical-representations-of-changing-quantities.html#U4H310 style="text-align: center"}

Rolling, kicking, throwing, and catching a ball are familiar activities
for most people. To describe mathematically what is happening to the
ball, however, one needs some technical skills: ways to label where the
ball is, its *position*, to describe how that position is changing, the
ball's *velocity*, and to think about how that velocity is changing, its
*acceleration.* By looking at graphs of how a ball's position, velocity,
and acceleration are changing with time, one can learn a lot about a
ball's motion -- is it at rest? Moving with constant speed? Speeding up?
Slowing down? Similarly, one can learn a lot about how a quantity of
interest is changing by looking at analogous graphs for that quantity,
such as how fast are the world's glaciers melting?

##### ***Question 4.14 How do position, velocity, and acceleration of a tossed ball change with time?*** {#chapter-038-developing-mathematical-representations-of-changing-quantities.html#U4H514 style="text-align: center"}

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;padding: 5px"}
To explore this question, use:

-   whiteboard,
-   basketball,
-   motion detector connected to a computer or graphing calculator
-   If a motion detector is not available, use:
-   Basketball
-   Stopwatch,
-   Flat board,
-   Meter stick or yard stick
-   Book or wood block to incline the flat board
:::

A motion detector works by emitting ultrasound waves that are reflected
from an object back to the detector. The detector reports how far away
the object is and makes a graph of position (where the object is) versus
time (the instant it was there). We use a Go Motion! detector that
connects directly to a computer
([https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/motion-detectors/](https://www.vernier.com/products/sensors/motion-detectors)).

-   Start by exploring what a motion looks like on a [position versus
    time graph]{style="text-decoration: underline"} (x vs t) with the
    vertical axis representing where the object is (x, its position with
    respect to the motion detector's position), and the horizontal axis
    representing the time the object was there (t, a clock reading).
    What can you find out about position vs. time graphs by standing
    still as well as by moving back and forth in front of the motion
    detector?
    -   [What does the [position versus time
        graph]{style="text-decoration: underline"} look like if you
        stand still in front of the motion detector? (If you do not have
        access to a motion detector, lay a meter or yard stick along a
        flat board, place the ball next to a numbered mark, and note its
        position there for multiple instants of time read on the
        stopwatch. Plot that position on a position vs. time
        graph.)]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}
    -   [What does the position versus time graph look like if you also
        stand farther away from the motion detector (or place the ball
        farther away from the end of the meter
        stick)?]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}
    -   [What does the [height]{style="text-decoration: underline"} of a

        a motion detector, design a way to measure positions and

the position versus time graph, the straight diagonal lines in the
velocity versus time graph, and the flat portions of the acceleration
versus time graph.]{style="color: #373d3f"}

**What story is the x vs t graph telling about where the ball is, its
position, during a toss?**

Height:Â  The height of a point on the position versus time graph
represents the ball's position, how far it is from the motion detector.
During the toss, the curved line is a parabola whose height is changing,
increasing to a maximum, then decreasing. The parabola represents the
changing position of the ball as the ball moves up, away from the motion
detector, to a maximum height, turns around (but does NOT stop at the
top), and falls back down toward the motion detector until caught. The
flat regions of the position versus time graph represent the time during
which the ball is held in the person's hand in the same low Â position
above the motion detector between tosses.

Slope:Â Â  The slope at a point on the position versus time graph
represents the rate at which the ball's position is changing, its
velocity at that point: During the toss, the slope is changing, the ball
is moving a different distance during each unit of time. On the trip
"up," the slope is getting less and less steep; the ball is moving
shorter and shorter distances during each unit of time. While still
moving in the positive direction, "up," Â the magnitude of the ball's
velocity is decreasing, that is, the ball is slowing down while moving
"up" in the positive direction. On the trip "down," the slope is getting
steeper and steeper; the ball is moving longer and longer distances
during each unit of time. While now moving in the negative direction,
"down," Â the magnitude of the ball's velocity is increasing, that is,
the ball is speeding up while falling "down" in the negative direction.

**What story is the v vs t graph telling about how fast the ball is
moving and in what direction, its velocity, during a toss?**

Height: The height at a point on the velocity versus time graph
represents the ball's velocity: During the toss, the line is a straight
diagonal with negative slope: when thrown "up," the ball starts out at a
high velocity in the positive direction,Â slows down in a regular way
while still moving "up" in the positive direction, turns around (v = 0),
and speeds up in a regular way while falling "down" in the negative
direction until caught.

A positive velocity means that the ball is moving in the positive
direction, "up" in this case. As the ball moves "up," however, it slows
down so the initially large positive velocity from the throw gets
smaller and smaller until the ball turns around (v=0) and starts falling
"down".

Note that there is no extended time period during which the velocity is
zero during the toss; the ball does not "stop" at the top during the
turn around. This contrasts with the short time period Â when the line
representing the velocity remains on the horizontal axis, at zero, while
the ball is being caught and briefly held before being tossed again.

A negative velocity means that the ball is moving in the negative
direction, back toward the motion detector. Although -8 on a number line
represents less than -1 on a number line, a velocity of --8
meters/second is much faster than a velocity of -1 meters/second. The
minus sign only indicates the direction the ball is going, "down" in
this case; the number indicates the magnitude of the velocity, how fast
the ball is moving.

In physics, the wordÂ *speed*Â refers to the magnitude of how fast the
ball is moving; the wordÂ *velocity*Â refers to both the magnitude and
direction of motion. If the ball's velocity isÂ  --8 meters/second, its
speed is 8 meters/second while the ball is moving in the negative
direction.

Slope: The slope at a point on the velocity versus time graph represents
the rate at which the ball's velocity is changing, its acceleration at
that point: If the slope is constant, the ball's velocity is changing by
the same amount during each unit of time. If the slope is constant and
negative, the ball's positive velocity is getting slower and slower in a
regular way during the "up" portion of the toss; the ball's negative
velocity is getting faster and faster in a regular way during the "down"
portion of the toss.

**[What story is the a vs t graph telling about how fast the ball's
velocity is changing, its acceleration, during the
toss?]{style="color: #373d3f"}**

[Height: The height of a point on the acceleration versus time graph
represents the ball's acceleration: During the toss, the line is flat, a
straight horizontal line, below the horizontal axis: the ball's
acceleration is negative and constant (about -10 meters/second, every
second) throughout the motion, whether the ball is going up or down.
]{style="color: #373d3f"} [This means that during the toss, the velocity
of the ball decreased by about 10 meters/second during each second of
the trip "up" and increased by about 10/second during each second of the
trip "down."Â ]{style="color: #373d3f"} [Thus interpreting this graph
provides an estimate of the quantity known as the acceleration of
gravity, which is often referred to as -9.8 meters/second^2^, where the
minus sign indicates that the direction of the acceleration is toward
the center of the Earth.Â ]{style="color: #373d3f"}

Slope: The slope at a point on the acceleration versus time graph
represents the ball's change in acceleration. During the toss, the slope
is zero, the ball's acceleration is not changing, its velocity changes
by the same negative amount for each unit of time during the entire
toss. In accordance with Newton's second law, F=ma, the force on the
ball is constant, the Earth is pulling on the ball in the same way, with
the same gravitational force, in the negative direction toward the
center of the Earth, during the entire trip, both up and down. (The
jagged peaks on this acceleration versus time graph represent the
varying acceleration caused by upward forces exerted on the ball by the
thrower in catching the ball, holding it briefly, and then tossing it
again.)

One connection among these graphs is that the 'event' of the ball
turning around is represented by the maximum height of the curved line
on the position versus time graph and by the straight diagonal line
crossing the horizontal axis at zero on the velocity versus time graph
but is not represented at all on the acceleration versus time graph.

These graphs are very powerful tools for understanding what is happening
when change is occurring. In particular, is something happening slower
and slower or faster and faster?

**Whenever you see a curve like the tossed ball (downward curved
parabola) something is happening either slower and slower, if the curve
is like the first half of the toss ("up"), or faster and faster if the
curve is like the second half of the toss ("down")**! Seeing a graph
with this shape is an alert that not only is change happening but the
rate of change is changing, accelerating. It may be hard to detect a
pattern when provided columns of numbers; asking for a graph of the data
may make visually salient the need for taking informed action.

### **B. Becoming aware of melting glaciers** {#chapter-038-developing-mathematical-representations-of-changing-quantities.html#U4H311 style="text-align: center;padding-left: 40px"}

One challenge scientists face is communicating to the public what seems
to be happening to the global climate and its impacts. One approach is
to develop and provide visual images that vividly convey the changes
that are occurring.

##### ***Question 4.15 What is the evidence that glaciers are melting?*** {#chapter-038-developing-mathematical-representations-of-changing-quantities.html#U4H515 style="text-align: center;padding-left: 40px"}

An example of a change occurring in nature is the melting of glaciers on
land. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, glacial ice
currently covers about 10 percent of the land on Earth. If all the ice
on Earth melted, sea levels would rise about 70 meters (230 feet) (see
<https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glaciers/quickfacts.html>).

When ice melts within a glacier, liquid water flows as streams into the
ocean. Glaciers also flow like rivers of ice very slowly toward the
ocean. *Calving* occurs when large chunks of ice break off the edge of a
glacier. Some glaciers have retreated substantially during the past
century, as shown by photographs taken in roughly the same place many
years apart.Â  Figure 4.45, for example, shows photographs of Muir
Glacier, Alaska, taken in 1941 and 2004 from roughly the same place.
These photos were included in the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) Climate 365 project to inform the public about
evidence of climate change
(Â [https://climate365.tumblr.com/](https://climate365.tumblr.com))

According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center, this glacier
retreated about seven miles during the 63 years between these
photographs. TheÂ NASA Climate 365 project is a collaboration of the NASA
Earth Science News Team, NASA Goddard and Jet Propulsion Laboratory
communications teams, and NASA websites Earth Observatory and Global
Climate Change. These photographs were taken by William O. Field on Aug.
13, 1941 (left) and by Bruce F. Molnia on Aug. 31, 2004 (right) and are
from the Glacier Photograph Collection. Boulder, Colorado USA: National
Snow and Ice Data Center/World Data Center for Glaciology.

Glacier National Park in Montana also has had major losses of glacial
ice. There were about 150 glaciers larger than 25 acres there a century
ago; now there are only 26 of at least that size
(<https://www.usgs.gov/news/glaciers-rapidly-shrinking-and-disappearing-50-years-glacier-change-montana>).
Decreases in the extent of glacial ice are most evident at the time of
maximum melt before new snow and ice form during late fall and winter.
Fig. 4.46, for example, shows an aerial photograph of Sperry Glacier in
late summer with outlines of its perimeter at similar times in 1966,
1998, 2005, and 2015.

â¢ Â What impact might the decline in the number and extent of glaciers
have on water resources in the region?

Data from satellite images have greatly enhanced scientists' ability to
document changes in the forming and melting of sea ice on the oceans as
well as glacial ice on land. The National Snow and Ice Data Center
(NSIDC) uses satellite data, for example, to monitor daily, monthly, and
yearly the extent to which sea ice covers the Arctic Ocean (See:
<http://nsidc.org/soac/sea-ice-more-information>).

Figure 4.47, for example, compares how much sea ice covered the Arctic
Ocean during October in 1981 (left) and during October in 2012 (right).
Blue represents regions where sea ice covered more area than normal
during October, where normal was defined as the average sea ice coverage
during the month of October for the period from 1979 to 2015. Red
represents regions where sea ice covered less area than normal for the
month of October, that is, areas with more open sea water than in the
past. Click on <http://nsidc.org/soac/sea-ice.html#seaice> and the
triangle to watch a graphic display of changes from October 1981 to
October 2016.

Ice reflects up to 70% of incoming solar radiation; open water, however,
reflects less than 10%. Therefore, changes in how much sea ice covers
Arctic waters, particularly during the summer, have a big impact on how
much energy is reflected back out to space or absorbed. Energy absorbed
increases both sea surface and atmospheric temperatures. See
[http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/](http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews)
for the latest Arctic Sea Ice News and Analysis.

Satellite data also have enabled scientists to document recent
acceleration of the movement of glaciers on land toward the Antarctic
Ocean due to winds and warm water currents (See:
[https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2631/wind-warm-water-revved-up-melting-antarctic-glaciers/](https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2631/wind-warm-water-revved-up-melting-antarctic-glaciers).)
Figure 4.48, for example, represents the velocity of glaciers varying
from zero to 4000 meters per year. The area represented by the small
black box on the left is shown in detail on the right, with ocean depth
(Bathymetry in meters) and arrows representing Antarctic Circumpolar
Currents (ACC) bringing warmer ocean water into Marguerite Bay.

global sea levels?

### **C. Making an analogy between falling balls and melting glaciers** {#chapter-038-developing-mathematical-representations-of-changing-quantities.html#U4H312 style="text-align: center;padding-left: 40px"}

A big question in the 1990s and early 2000s was whether the glaciers on
Greenland were growing or shrinking. See a story about scientists'
attempts to resolve this issue at
<https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Greenland/greenland.php> .
New data from the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment)
satellite project were interpreted by Isabella Velicogna (seeÂ 
<https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Greenland/greenland3.php>
and
<https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Greenland/greenland4.php> ).

The graph in FIG. 4.50 presents data derived from the GRACE satellite
from 2002 to 2014. The red stars represent June values of the mass of
ice.

-   What do the downward black lines starting at a red star represent?
-   What do the upward black lines ending in the red stars represent?
-   In which cycles was more ice formed during the cold season than
    melted during the warm season?
-   In which cycles was more ice melted during the warm season than
    formed during the cold season?
-   The blue curve fits the overall trend of these data. Was the slope
    of the trend getting steeper? About the same? Getting less steep?\
    What does that imply about the rate of melting during this time
    period?\
    Melting faster and faster? Melting about the same? Melting slower
    and slower?

Â 

Note that the vertical axis of Fig. 4.50 represents the *cumulative mass
anomaly* in gigatons of ice. An *anomaly* is a difference with respect
to a reference, often an average value over an extended time period.
This graph represents the difference between the total mass of ice on a
particular date and a reference total mass represented by the 0 on the
vertical axis.

By looking at the graph, for example, one can estimate that the mass of
ice in June 2002 was about 1300 gigatons more than the reference mass
whereas the mass of ice in June 2013 was about 1500 gigatons less than
the reference mass of ice. Between 2002 and 2013, about 2800 gigatons of
ice on Greenland melted. The absolute mass of ice in gigatons that is
the reference is not provided here.

For a discussion of why changing amounts often are analyzed via
anomalies rather than changes in absolute amounts, see
<https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/monitoring-references/dyk/anomalies-vs-temperature>.
Note also that something interesting happened during the ice melts for
2012 and 2014, which raises the interesting issue of what might happen
next!

Analysis of ice melting in Greenland is one case. What is happening to
glaciers world wide? As shown in Fig. 4.51, the World Glacier Monitoring
Service (WGMS) produced similarly shaped graphs representing cumulative
mass change for glaciers based on measurements from 1950 to 2018,
compared to their masses in 1976
([https://wgms.ch/global-glacier-state/](https://wgms.ch/global-glacier-state)).

Interpret Fig. 4.51:

-   What does the horizontal axis represent?
-   What does the vertical axis represent?
-   What do the lines represent?
-   What does the shape of the lines imply about world-wide changes in
    the mass of glaciers?

##### The colored line graphs represent data from reference glaciers in ten regions world wide. The dashed black line represents the average cumulative mass change for all ten regions.Â During 2015-2016, theÂ World Glacier Monitoring Service collected data from more than 130 glaciers around the world ([http://wgms.ch/latest-glacier-mass-balance-data/](http://wgms.ch/latest-glacier-mass-balance-data)). Of these, 40 were "reference" glaciers for which they had continuous data for more than 30 years.

##### The difference between the mass of ice gained during the cold season and the mass of ice that melted during the warm season is the annual net mass balance. The plots are cumulative, increasing or decreasing the reference total by how much mass of ice has been added or lost each year since 1950.

    Draw a line on the mass of ice versus time graph to show what has
    been happening and your projection of what is likely to happen in
    the next decade(s) based on this analogy with the position versus
    time graph for a falling ball.
-   Below your mass of ice versus time graph, draw the axes for a
    velocity of melting versus time graph as shown in Fig. 4.52.
-   Draw a line on the velocity of melting graph that is analogous to
    the shape of the graph of velocity versus time graph for a falling
    ball to make a projection for how the velocity of melting will
    change in the next decade(s).
-   Below your velocity of melting versus time graph, draw the axes for
    an acceleration of melting versus time graph as shown in Fig. 4.52.
-   Draw a line on the acceleration of melting graph that is analogous
    to the acceleration versus time graph for a falling ball to make a
    projection for how the acceleration of melting will change in the
    next decade(s). Assume that melting ice is a natural process like
    that of the gravitational pull by the earth on a falling object. It
    may be or it may not be; the acceleration of the rate of melting ice
    may decrease OR increase if the people who on live on this Earth do
    or do not change their ways.

#### *1. Example of student work making an analogy between moving and melting phenomena* {#chapter-038-developing-mathematical-representations-of-changing-quantities.html#U4H418 style="padding-left: 40px"}

***Developing and using mathematical model of changing phenomena.*** *By
watching the trailer and the TED talk we are able to learn about the
changes that are happening in Greenland. The glaciers are melting and
falling off into the ocean, through the trailer you could see actual
images of this happening and it was unlike anything I had ever seen
before. These live images really put climate change into perspective for
me and make me realize how quickly it is changing.Â *

*The shape of this graph is a parabola, which looks like an upside down
U. The position of the ball after it leaves the person's hand goes up so
the line on the graph has an upward slope and at the point of turnaround
it comes back down to the person's hand and the graph goes into a
downward motion.*

*Velocity is how quickly the position the ball is in is changing.
Velocity started at a high point but as the ball is being thrown in an
upward direction, the velocity is decreasing. When the ball hits the
point of turnaround the velocity is zero. When the ball starts going in
a downward direction the velocity is increasing in the negative
direction.*

***An acceleration versus time graph represents how quickly the velocity
of a tossed ball is changing during a time interval.***

*The force of Earth is always pulling the ball down, which is why the
line is in the negative position on the graph. It doesn't change because
Earth is always pulling down on the ball during any point of the ball's
flight. The "loggerlite" program represents this constant downward pull
by having the line be in the negative position.*

***A mass of ice versus time graph represents how much mass of ice there
is during a time interval.***

*This graph starts half way because this is when they just started
taking data from 2002-2014. The slope is increasing. The height of the
peak is the winter months because once it is frozen again the mass
increases. The low point represents more of the ice melt because there
is less ice during the warm summer months. Based on the data that has
been collected, showing that there is increasingly more ice melting I
can predict that by 2024 the graph will continue in the downward slope
as I have shown above...*

*The slope (on the mass vs time graph) is increasing when you compare
the years 2002-2004 and 2012-2014. The magnitude of the velocity (of ice
melting) in this case is increasing, which in return means that the mass
is decreasing. This graph shows that every year there is becoming less
mass of ice.*

***Acceleration of the melting ice melting versus time graph represents
how quickly the velocity of ice melting is changing during a time
interval.***

*The shape of this graph is a straight line in the negative region of
the graph. The acceleration is constant, the line does not have any
changes to it. Something is causing the ice to melt but in this case we
can change it, unlike the force of gravity pulling down the ball.*

***Making an analogy to a known process can help one predict a similar
process in a different context.*** *Using the information we have
gathered from these graphs, we can predict other trends as well. In the
business world predicting graphs is used all the time to predict the
success of businesses or stocks.*

#### *2. Summary of the analogy between moving and melting phenomena* {#chapter-038-developing-mathematical-representations-of-changing-quantities.html#U4H419 style="text-align: center"}

Table IV.4b provides a summary of the analogy between moving and melting
phenomena. The position versus time, velocity versus time, and
acceleration versus time graphs on the left represent the motion of a
ball tossed vertically in the air from the instant that the ball starts
falling back down until the instant that it is caught before hitting the
ground. The heights and slopes of these graphs provide information about
this motion as described in the left columns. The ball speeds up as it
falls, accelerating at a constant rate because the Earth is pulling on
the ball in the same way throughout the toss.

The mass of ice versus time graph on the right represents the observed
decrease in the mass of the Greenland ice sheet as observed from 2002 to
2014 (Khan et al., 2015). The dotted line represents a projection for
how this ice sheet might continue melting in the future. The heights and
slopes of the melting ice graphs provide projections for increasing rate
and acceleration of this melting phenomena as described in the right
columns. If the shape of the line representing the rate of ice melting
is similar to the rate of the ball falling, the rate of ice melting will
speed up, accelerating as time goes by. Although the acceleration of the
ball is constant, due to the natural process of the Earth pulling on the
ball in the same way throughout its fall, the acceleration of the loss
of mass due to melting may be modified by human actions, to reduce (or
increase) the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Â 

The purpose of this section has been to illustrate the power of
mathematics. One can use mathematics to represent something one
understands, such as motion phenomena, and then by analogy make
projections for interesting phenomena that seem to be behaving in a
similar way.

The above projections were for increasing loss of ice in Greenland
during the next decade. The graph in Fig. 4.50, however, showed an
apparent "lull" in the accelerating loss of ice in Greenland when the
mass of freezing of ice during the 2014 winter appeared to have matched
the mass of melting ice during the summer of 2013. What has happened
since then? See
<https://www.euronews.com/2019/08/06/before-and-after-pictures-show-greenland-s-rapid-ice-melt-from-space>
for a news cast during August 2019. See
[http://nsidc.org/greenland-today/](http://nsidc.org/greenland-today)Â to
find out what is happening "now" when you are reading about this topic.
See
<https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/greenland-antarctica-melting-six-times-faster-than-in-the-1990s>
for a comparison of melting of ice in Greenland and Antarctica over
several decades.

#### *3. Example of student work reflecting upon engaging a friend or family member in learning about global climate change's impact on melting glaciers.* {#chapter-038-developing-mathematical-representations-of-changing-quantities.html#U4H420 style="text-align: center"}

*For this activity, I had my friend watch Chasing Ice so that they could
see the drastic effects that are happening to ice shelves. She first
asked me where this was and I told her that it was in Greenland. She
then made a statement and said, "so this doesn't really matter for us
then since it is so far away?" I asked her if she really thinks that if
the Earth is warming up so much that it is melting this ice, that it is
not going to affect us and she said, "well when you put it that way I
guess it will." She was very surprised that she didn't already know
about this because it seems like an important thing. I told her it is
important and many countries are taking steps to stop the effects of
global warming because many scientists have said that it is because of
human's effects on the Earth. She then asked what she could do and I
took her to the website that talked about ways that she could reduce her
carbon footprint. She liked the idea of biking places instead of
driving. She told me that she couldn't believe how big her carbon
footprint was.*

*The NGSS standard that goes with this is engaging in argument from
evidence and we did a little bit of this because at first, she didn't
think that the melting of the ice would be affecting her and through my
argument from evidence of warming, I was able to teach her that it
wasn't true. I also used cause and effect because we could see the
effect that our carbon footprint and global warming was causing these
huge ice shelves to melt in Greenland*.

Becoming aware of what seems to be happening world wide with respect to
the impacts of global climate change can be quite sobering. It is
helpful also to become aware of what individuals, communities,
universities, states, the military, government agencies, and countries
can do and are doing to address climate change issues.

Critical in these endeavors is the process ofÂ *engineering design* in
which people, as individuals as well as participants in institutions,
define problems and then develop and optimize solutions. (See Appendix I
of theÂ *Next Generation Science Standards* (NGSS Lead States, 2013) at
<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices> .) Â Such
focused efforts Â are necessary both in developing improved ways of
documenting what is happening as well as in designing better ways to
reduce the causes and impact of increasing global temperatures.Â Also
relevant is understanding the interdependence of science, engineering
and technology as well as the influence of engineering, technology and
science on society and the natural world. (See Appendix J).

#### *1. Example of student work in reflecting upon exploring Internet resources* *in class and with a friend or family member* {#chapter-039-exploring-internet-resources-about-taking-action-to-address-climate-change-issues.html#U4H421}

***Exploring Internet resources about global climate change:***

-   *[Individuals]{style="text-decoration: underline"}:
    [http://extremeicesurvey.org/take-action/](http://extremeicesurvey.org/take-action)*

*This information was provided by the Extreme Ice Survey. I thought the
information was interesting because it talked about having a voice and
getting the word out about climate change. I found the facts he provided
would be helpful in talking to someone who doesn't believe in climate
change and may aid someone in that discussion. I also found the facts to
be helpful in my learning about climate change because they were short,
easy to read facts that made a big statement, for example: Worldwide,
hundreds of thousands of people die each year from climate-related
stressors. In a short amount of words they present a scary statistic
that people shouldn't ignore.*

-   *[Individuals]{style="text-decoration: underline"}:
    <https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/public/public.htm>*

*The agency presenting this information is the California Air Resources
Board. This website was very interesting because it suggested many ways
as an individual you can help with climate change by doing things you
wouldn't really think of as helping. One that was somewhat surprising to
me was washing your clothes in cold water, which is something I usually
do anyways to prevent my clothes from shrinking or stretching out. A
point it talked about that I found interesting was that these small
changes quickly become habit, even though at some point it seemed like
it would too much work. The example it used for this was recycling
products at your house. When I was younger, we usually threw cans away,
and now we always put them in a separate garbage can for recycling and
it's just habit. I think this helped my learning because it used very
real life examples that are definitely possible for almost everyone, so
it was easy to understand how small changes by everyone can make a big
difference.*

-   *[Individuals]{style="text-decoration: underline"}:
    <https://www.epa.gov/climatechange/what-you-can-do-about-climate-change>
    (To view this go to
    <https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/climatechange/what-you-can-do-about-climate-change_.html>
    )*

*Â Â Â Â Â  This resource from the EPA, which offers tips on what you can
change to improve your global impact, is really well organized and super
easy to find good information from. In particular, you can choose to see
what things you can do at home, at work, on the road, and at school to
help climate change. Also, the options to which you can use to change
are really simple and helpful options.*

-   *[Communities]{style="text-decoration: underline"}:
    <https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/community-based-adaptation_handout.pdf>*

*I really liked how organized this document was, and how it showed
images and had many highlighted and bullet pointed sections. They stated
ways to have cleaner air in cities, which included reducing vehicle
emissions by creating areas where people can work, live and play within
a walkable area, and upgrading municipal fleets to reduce air
pollutants.Â  I really like their idea about making a living space where
everything is in walking distance---it got me thinking of ways that
entire communities could live in the future where work and home and
greenspace were all condensed into a small area.Â  This could solve a lot
of problems and leave more space for trees and wildlife- trees are
important for reducing carbon emissions as well.Â *

-   *[Oregon State University]{style="text-decoration: underline"}:
    <http://seagrant.oregonstate.edu/key-issues/resilient-communities-and-economies/climate-change-adaptation>*

*The university helps support climate change research while also finding
ways to use that research to help people find ways to live and work in
their everyday lives. I think this is important to making a difference
because not everyone will go out of their way to support the issue, but
they will be more likely to do small things at home in their everyday
lives if they know it will make a difference.*

-   *[The State of Oregon]{style="text-decoration: underline"}:
    <http://www.oregon.gov/energy/energy-oregon/Pages/Climate-Change.aspx>*

*The state of Oregon partners with multiple agencies to track things
like greenhouse gas emissions and how we can reduce them in order to
reduce climate change. Oregon also promotes creating electricity with
renewable energy instead of materials like coal, which was very
interesting to me. By supporting research and trends, Oregon is active
in trying to more efficiently create resources for the state in ways
that do not harm our atmosphere.*

-   *[Military:]{style="text-decoration: underline"}
    <https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/MAB_5-8-14.pdf>*

*The military discusses climate change as it relates to foreign affairs.
They want to work to end climate change as it is a threat to stability
of other countries as an aggravated stressor, enabling violence and
terrorist activity. Additionally, it is important that the military is
protecting our national security rather than responding to human caused
natural disasters.*

-   *[US Government]{style="text-decoration: underline"}:
    <http://www.globalchange.gov>*

*This website includes multiple different kinds of resources and forms
of information. I really liked that it included a tab about
understanding climate change because I think understanding the issue is
the first step in actually taking action. Overall, this website is very
organized and leads me to believe that the US government is taking part
in lessoning the effects of climate change not only on our country but
on the world as well. This piece of information was specifically
surprising to me: "U.S. average temperature has increased by 1.3Â°F to
1.9Â°F since 1895, and most of this increase has occurred since 1970. The
most recent decade was the Nation's and the world's hottest ever
recorded, and 2012 was the hottest year on record in the continental
United States. Temperatures are projected to rise another 2Â°F to 4Â°F in
most areas of the U.S. over the next few decades."*

-   *[Collaboration of Countries]{style="text-decoration: underline"}:
    [http://www.ipcc.ch/](http://www.ipcc.ch)*

*"Each IPCC Member country has a Focal Point which has been identified
by the relevant authorities in the country. IPCC Focal Points prepare
and update the list of national experts to help implement the IPCC work
programme. The Focal Points also arrange for the provision of integrated
comments on the accuracy and completeness of the scientific and/or
technical content and the overall scientific and/or technical balance of
drafts of reports." I found this piece of information from the website
discussing how countries interact with one another. By giving leaders of
each country a specific role, those tasks are more likely to be
completed than if there was no communication or designated roles.*

-   ***Engaging friend(s) and/or family member(s) in learning about the
    science underlying claims about global climate change.***

*I engaged my roommate in learning about the underlying claims of global
climate change. I started by asking her what she knew about climate
change in general. She admitted that she had heard a lot of kind of
jokes about climate change and the occasional tweet here and there, but
had never taken the time to actually look into the issue.*

*Â I explained to her a couple of the things we had learned in class so
far such as greenhouse gas emissions, rising sea levels, and rising
temperatures and why each of these are important. I then asked her about
each one of the topics such as what do you think OSU, the state of
Oregon, the US government, and the nation as a whole does to prevent
climate change? We explored the sites I mentioned above together. She
specifically thought the one focused on the efforts of the U.S.
government was interesting because it gave her a lot of definitions,
general information, news reports and many more resources, which
provides multiple different perspectives. By reviewing this website she
was also convinced that the issue is indeed important and is worth
taking the time to research and do small things at home such as save
energy and travel efficiently.*

*I liked discussing this because I felt like I was teaching someone
about something that really does matter and is important. This makes me
believe that putting the time and effort into science lessons can have
not only a positive impact on the learner but on the world. I think this
connects with the NGSS science and engineering practice constructing
explanations and designing solutions because by doing research, we are
able to understand and explain the phenomena to some extent and then
come up with a solution based off of the knowledge previously gained.
This also correlates to the cross cutting concept of cause and effect
because the way we live and use energy causes the greenhouse gasses that
affect the atmosphere.*

Scientists all over the world have worked hard to understand the causes
of changes in the world's climate that are now occurring more rapidly
than in the past, the impacts of those changes, and ways to address
those issues. They also have worked hard to communicate their findings
and interpretations of these findings. Decisions by individuals as well
as by policy makers will affect what happens in the years to come. We
close this unit with attention to relevant NGSS disciplinary core ideas
and understandings about the nature of science.

### **A. Learning more about disciplinary core ideas articulated in the USÂ *Next Generation Science Standards*** {#chapter-040-making-connections-to-educational-policies-2.html#U2H314 style="text-align: center;"}

The US *Next Generation Standards* includes *global climate changeÂ *as a
disciplinary core idea that students should learn about by the end of
middle school, that *human activities affect global warming. Decisions
to reduce the impact of global warming depend on understanding climate
science, engineering capabilities, and social dynamics.*

##### ***Question 4.18 What relevant US NGSS disciplinary core ideas have you used in considering the influence of light and thermal phenomena on global climate change?*** {#chapter-040-making-connections-to-educational-policies-2.html#U4H518 style="text-align: center;"}

The USÂ *Next Generation Science Standards* (NGSS Lead States, 2013)
suggests disciplinary core ideas for teaching science topics in grades
K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12. TheseÂ *learning progressions*Â suggest ways to
build disciplinary knowledge throughout schooling.Â Table IV.5 presents
the learning progressions articulated for teaching about disciplinary
core ideas related to global climate change. Relevant disciplinary core
ideas in physical science include electromagnetic radiation,
conservation of energy and energy transfer. Disciplinary core ideas in
earth and space sciences include weather and climate and global climate
change. Bolded statements are addressed in this course.

-   Discuss with your group members ways in which you have used some
    aspects of the disciplinary core ideas that are relevant to teaching
    about global climate change.
-   Select one of these that has been the most interesting for you
    during this course and discuss how and what you have learned. Also
    include in your discussion at least one NGSS science and engineering
    practice and at least one crosscutting concept that you used while
    learning about this disciplinary core idea.

: TABLE IV.5 Relevant NGSS disciplinary core ideas relevant to teaching
about global climate change
:::

### **B. Reflecting upon this exploration of the science underlying claims of global climate change** {style="text-align: center;"}

Scientists base claims about global climate change on evidence. They
report their studies in peer-reviewed articles that describe in detail
the questions they are asking, why these questions are of interest, what
already is known about these issues, how they design their
investigations, the results they obtain, and the implications of those
findings. Since 1988, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) has provided a way for scientists all over the world to
collaborate in assembling and assessing such evidence in order to
provide the public and policy makers with the best information possible
on which to base decisions. This unit began by developing understandings
about infrared radiation and its role in the greenhouse effect, which is
an explanation for the natural phenomenon of a warm atmosphere
surrounding the surface of the Earth. Students also examined evidence
for the recent increase in the global average temperature of that
atmosphere, the impact of that increase in temperature on rising sea
levels, and ways that individuals, communities, states, nations, and
international organizations are taking action to address global climate
change issues.

### **C. Making connections to NGSS understandings about the nature of science** {style="text-align: center;"}

The *Next Generation Science StandardsÂ *articulates eight understandings
that students should learn about the nature of science Â (*Next
Generation Science Standards*Â Lead States, 2013, Appendix H)
(<https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices>.) :

*Scientific investigations use a variety of methods.*Â As discussed in
section IV.B, for example, studies of glaciers have ranged from 'on the
ground' vivid video recordings of glacial calving events in Greenland
such as the *Chasing IceÂ *documentary to complex analyses of data from
satellites monitoring the acceleration of Antarctica's glaciers flowing
toward the ocean.

*Scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence.Â *As discussed in
section V.A.3, for example, scientists collaborating through the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have provided policy makers
with a series of graphs showing the increase in mean global temperature,
increase in sea levels, increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases
in the atmosphere, and increase in emissions of carbon dioxide from
human activities from 1850 to recent times.

*Scientific knowledge is open to revision in light of new evidence.Â *As
discussed in sections III.A, 2 and 3, development of knowledge about
light from the Sun is a good example of this aspect of the nature of
science. Such knowledge was limited to light that human eyes can detect
until William Herschel explored the heating effects of different colors
of the spectrum produced by shining sunlight through a prism. In 1800,
he reported that a thermometer placed outside the red end of the
spectrum also warmed and attributed this to "*invisible rays from the
sun*" that were "*invested with a high power of heating bodies, but with
none of illuminating objects."* Scientists have now observed that energy
coming to Earth from the Sun in this form of infrared radiation is
almost as much as the energy in light visible to human eyes. In 1801,
Wilhem Ritter discovered ultraviolet radiation from the Sun, invisible
radiation beyond the violet part of the spectrum. Over the next 100
years, scientists from many different countries contributed to new
knowledge about these invisible forms of light. The spectrum now ranges
from very large radio waves to tiny gamma rays with "visible light that
human eyes can see" being only a very small region of the entire
electromagnetic spectrum.

*Science models, laws, mechanisms and theories explain natural
phenomena.* As discussed in section IV.B, for example, the natural
greenhouse effect is an explanatory model of what happens when light
from the Sun shines on the Earth. As shown in Fig. 4.15, some of the
light from the Sun is immediately reflected back to space; some is
absorbed and warms the surface of the Earth; some gets emitted back out
into the atmosphere as infrared radiation and travels on out to space;
some, however, is absorbed by greenhouse gases instead and then
re-emitted, with some of that infrared radiation traveling back toward
the surface of the Earth. If more energy from the Sun enters than leaves
the Earth, the global mean temperature will continue to increase.

*Science is a way of knowing.* As discussed in section V.A.3, the
reports produced by the many scientists participating in the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are examples that
*science knowledge is cumulative and many people from many generations
and nations have contributed to science knowledge.Â *As noted above,
*theÂ IPCC Fifth Assessment's section on The Physical Science
BasisÂ *included 1409 pages prepared by Working Group
1Â *([https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1/](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg1)).*This
group includedÂ a team of 209 coordinating-lead authors and lead authors,
50 review editors, and more than 600 contributing authors from all over
the world. Their work was reviewed by 1089 expert reviewers and 38
governments. The result was a detailed presentation of the consensus
about evidence that underlies claims made about climate change by
scientists from around the world.

*Scientific knowledge assumes an order and consistency in natural
systems.* In particular, by the end of middle school, students should
understand that *science assumes that objects and events in natural
systems occur in coherent patterns that are understandable through
measurement and observation.* As shown in Fig. 4.20, for example,
observation of local mean temperatures all over the world have been
combined to show global patterns in the changes in temperature from 1880
to the present, with the past five years being the warmest of the last
140 years. As shown in Fig. 4.51, for example, the World Glacier
Monitoring Service is comparing the cumulative mass of ice change in
glaciers all over the world based on measurements from 1950 to the
present in an effort to identify patterns in what is happening to
melting glaciers as the mean global temperature rises.

*Science is a human endeavor.Â *The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change is an example of the way that scientists all over the world are
collaborating with one another to collect and analyze data that provide
evidence on which to base understandings about what is happening to the
Earth's climate. The IPCC reports demonstrate that *men and women from
different social, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds work as scientists
and engineers* as well as that *scientists and engineers rely on human
qualities such as persistence, precision, reasoning, logic, imagination
and creativity.*

*Science addresses questions about the natural and material world.* By
the end of middle school, students should understand thatÂ *science
limits its explanations to systems that lend themselves to observation
and empirical evidence.* As implied in section VIII, other aspects of
human endeavor also are necessary for individuals, communities, states,
nations, and international organizations to take action to address the
climate change already underway and predicted for the future. Examples
include individuals committing to live more sustainably based on
analyzing their own carbon footprints, military experts publicly
advocating for ways to prepare for a crisis denied by many, and
government officials undertaking unpopular measures to reduce emissions.
Such actions embodying the human qualities of commitment and courage as
well as curiosity can inspire hope for the future of our planet.

The theme for this course is *what happens when light from the Sun
shines on the Earth? Â *Although labeled the fifth unit, these
explorations extend throughout the course rather than occurring only
near the end. While exploring these phenomena, you will be:

-   ***identifying resources*** such as what you already may have seen
    in the sky, heard in songs, and studied in school
-   ***developing central ideas based on evidence*** that you record in
    systematic observations of the sky
-   ***explaining intriguing phenomena*** such as why the moon seems to
    change shape and size
-   ***developing mathematical representations*** of the arrangement of
    the Sun/Earth/Moon system
-   ***using mathematical representations to estimate a quantity of
    interest*** such as how soon Earth will be where you are seeing the
    third quarter Â Moon 'is' right now in space and
-   ***making connections to educational policy***, such as the *Next
    Generation Science Standards* (NGSS Lead States, 2013), the science
    standards adopted by many US departments of education.

While learning about the Sun and the Moon, you also will be learning
about learning processes as you summarize and reflect upon your
explorations. Discussions in class and assignments at home will include
integrating science and literacy learning, such as speaking clearly,
listening closely, writing coherently, reading with comprehension, and
creating and critiquing media.

The main sections present questions with suggestions for exploring
topics and for writing reflections about your findings. Text in gray
font indicates that these are suggestions; you may think of other ways
to explore the topic. Asking your own questions as well as those posed
here will enhance learning both about physics and about learning. Check
with your instructor if you choose to devise an alternative approach.

Keeping track of what one is doing and thinking is important. In this
course, use a template for a physics notebook page on which to record
your notes during class. The physics notebook page can help you remember
your thoughts *before, during,* and *after* an exploration. An
experienced elementary teacher, Adam Devittt, designed this notebook
page to mirror the structure of *before, during,* and *after* reading
strategies:

[Before]{style="text-decoration: underline"} starting your exploration,
think about and discuss with your group members what you know already
about the topic, how you plan to conduct the exploration, and what you
think you might find out.

[During]{style="text-decoration: underline"} your exploration, record
what is happening, what you are observing, and what you are thinking
about what you are observing. Include sketches of equipment and
observations. Note any words that are new and their definitions.

[After]{style="text-decoration: underline"} your exploration, record any
central ideas that have emerged from your observations and discussions.
Also note the evidence on which you have based these ideas. State
explicitly how the evidence is relevant and supports the claims you are
making in stating the ideas. Also explain why this result is important.
Then write a reflection about whatever you want to remember about this
experience. In addition, briefly state what you are still wondering in
this context.

After class, use your physics notebook pages and any handouts to write a
summary of your exploration and findings. Writing such a summary after
every class is a good way to prepare for the midterm and final
examinations.

Next, to be sure you have understood the physics involved, read this
text and some examples of student work. The student authors first wrote
drafts, received feedback for ways to enhance content and clarity, and
submitted these final versions. Also read about some nuances to be aware
of in these contexts.

You may also find helpful students' reflections about teaching friends
and/or family members about what they had just learned in class,
historical information about ways knowledge about the topic developed,
and some relevant aspects of the nature of science in the context of the
topic explored. These sections of the text may broaden your
understanding of science and of science learning and teaching.

You already know a lot about the Sun, Moon, and the stars from everyday
experiences being outside and going to school. You also likely have
absorbed information informally from songs, newspapers, books, and the
Internet. These are resources on which to build a deeper understanding
through systematic explorations in this class.

### **A. Documenting initial knowledge about the Sun, Moon, and stars** {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H31}

##### ***Question 5.1 What do you already know about the Sun, Â Moon, and stars?*** {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H51 style="text-align: center"}

Document your initial knowledge about the Sun, Moon, and stars by
responding to the following *diagnostic questions.* Â Your responses will
not be graded. You will answer the same questions again near the end of
the unit, compare initial and current responses, and write a reflection
about changes in your understandings and about the ways these occurred.

### **B. Noticing the sky** {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H32}

The key to learning about the sky is to look up whenever outside!
Frequently! You can draw on resources from your own experiences, from
those interpreted in cultural stories, art, and poetry, and from
observations you and companions make, even young children, when noticing
and talking about the Moon.

##### ***Question 5.2 What do you remember about experiences when you have seen the*** ***Sun, Moon, and/or stars?*** {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H52 style="text-align: center"}

-   Talk with your group members about some of your experiences in
    watching a sunrise or sunset, seeing the Moon, and/or noticing the
    stars.
-   What did you learn from these experiences?
-   How might you increase how often you notice the sky during this
    course?

##### ***Question 5.3 How have people noticed and represented the Sun, Moon, and stars*** ***in cultural stories, art, and poetry?*** {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H53 style="text-align: center"}

Story-tellers from many cultures as well as artists and poets have
offered intriguing interpretations of what they were seeing.

#### *1. The Sun, Moon, and stars as represented in cultural stories* {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H41 style="text-align: left"}

</div>

People from many cultures around the world have told stories about the
Sun, Moon, and stars
(see:Â <http://solar-center.stanford.edu/folklore/Solar-Folklore.pdf>).Â They
have observed and pondered changes in where the Sun seems to rise and
set, how high the Sun seems to arc across the sky, and how long daylight
or darkness lasts. They also have wondered why the Moon seems to change
its shape as well as when and where one sees the Moon with respect to
the Sun. Also puzzling has been why the stars seem to be arranged the
way they are and how they seem to move. People all over the Earth have
watched and wondered about such questions
(<https://www.lpi.usra.edu/planetary_news/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Multicultural_Astronomy_2013_v7.1.pdf>
).

People also have "seen" a variety of creatures residing on the full
Moon. These have included a human face, a man collecting firewood, a
woman and child, a rabbit, a princess, a toad and a tree
(see:Â [https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/the-man-in-the-moon-or-the-rabbit-or-toad-or-or-or/563450/](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/07/the-man-in-the-moon-or-the-rabbit-or-toad-or-or-or/563450)Â ).

In addition, people have envisioned many objects and creatures outlined
by the stars (See:
<https://www.aavso.org/sites/default/files/education/vsa/Chapter3.pdf>).
Where we live in the northern hemisphere, for example, stars that seem
to outline the shape of ladles, the *Big Dipper* and the *Little
Dippe*r, are often visible even in a city sky.Â  As shown in Fig. 5.1,
two stars forming part of the cup of the *Big Dipper* seem to point to a
star at the end of the handle in the *Little Dipper*. This star, known
as the *North Star*, does not seem to move whereas other stars seem to
revolve around it during the night.

The stars forming the dippers are contained within the constellations
known as *Ursa Major* (*Great Bear*) and *Ursa Minor* (*Little Bear*) as
shown in Fig. 5.2. *Ursa* is the Latin word for bear. People of many
cultures have associated various animals with these visual patterns of
stars and told stories about them
(see:Â <https://www.modernconstellations.com/classictau-vir.html#UMa>).
The *North Star* also is called *Polaris,* from the Latin *Stella
Polaris* or *Pole Star*
([https://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/skytellers/polaris/](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/skytellers/polaris)).
As seen from Earth, this star lies almost directly above the Earth's
north pole and appears to be motionless as the other stars seem to
revolve around it during the night.

These star patterns also appear in Native American constellations such
as those shown in the Ojibwe Sky Star Map at
<https://web.stcloudstate.edu/aslee/OJIBWEMAP/home.html>. The stars that
look like the *Big Dipper* and *Little Dipper* in Fig. 5.1 and part of
*Ursa Majo*r and *Ursa Minor* in Fig. 5.2 form part of the Ojibwe
constellations *Ojiig, the Fisher*, and *Manng, the Loon* (See:
<https://web.stcloudstate.edu/aslee/OJIBWEMAP/OjibweConstellationGuide.pdf>).\
The big star in the tail of *Maang* represents *Giwedin'anung*, a star
around which the other constellations appear to revolve. The Ojibwe
constellations shown in the Ojibwe Sky Star Map are superimposed on
constellations based on myths from ancient Greek and Roman times such as
those shown in Fig. 5.3.

If you live in the northern hemisphere, on a clear night see if you can
find the Big Dipper, Little Dipper and the North Star. Can you also see
Ursa Major, follow this Great Bear's pointer stars to Polaris, and
recognize the Little Bear, Ursa Minor? If you can watch for several
hours, you can see the other stars appear to revolve around a star that
seems to be motionless as shown in Fig. 5.4.

If you live in the southern hemisphere, there is no star in the sky that
seems motionless during the night. You can infer where such a point
would be, however, by using two bright stars to envision the location of
the third apex of an equilateral triangle as shown in
<https://centralaustralianbushwalkers.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/skymap-south-by-stars-pdf.jpg>.
You can see the apparent motion of constellations around a point in the
sky if you can watch over several hours. On a clear night, also see if
you can find the Southern Cross, Centaurus the Centaur with Alpha
Centauri, a star system just 4.37 light years away as well as Omega
Centauri, a globular cluster, and other celestial sights. (See;
[https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/beginners-guide-to-the-southern-hemisphere-sky/](https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/beginners-guide-to-the-southern-hemisphere-sky)).

#### *2. The Sun, Moon, and stars represented in art* {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H42}

Many artists have noticed and portrayed the Sun, Moon, and stars. The
Dutch artist Vincent Van Gogh, for example, included them in many
paintings such as *The Sower at Sunset* in 1888 and *The Starry Night*
in 1889 as shown in Fig. 5.5 and Fig. 5.6.

#### *3. The Sun, Moon, and stars represented in poetry* {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H43}

Many poems about the Sun, Moon, and stars reflect primarily upon the
writer's emotions, situation, and surroundings. Several poets, however,
have described physical aspects of ways that the Sun, Moon, and stars
appear to move and/or look.

Robert Louis Stevenson, for example, described the Sun's apparent motion
around the Earth as it seems to create on-going experiences of *morning
after morning*. Children on one side of the Earth are getting up and
playing while those on the other side of the Earth are going to bed.

*The Sun Travels* By Robert Louis Stevenson

The Sun is not a-bed, when I\
At night upon my pillow lie;\
Still round the earth his way he takes,\
And morning after morning makes.

While here at home, in shining day,\
We round the sunny garden play,\
Each little Indian sleepy-head\
Is being kissed and put to bed.

And when at eve I rise from tea,\
Day dawns beyond the Atlantic Sea;\
And all the children in the West\
Are getting up and being dressed.\

In a three-line poem, *Winter Moon,*Â Langston Hughes commented briefly
upon the shape of a crescent moon Â (see:

in *The Dream Keepers and Other PoemsÂ *published by Alfred A. Knopf,
Inc. in 1932, page 3). In the poem *Invention,* Billy Collins offered a
whimsical description of the Moon's changing phases. (see:

A poem by Jane Taylor, set to the French tune *Ah! vous dirai-je,
maman,* has been sung as a lullaby for more than two centuries.

*The Star\
*By Jane Taylor

Twinkle, twinkle little star,\
How I wonder what you are!\
Up above the world so high,\
Like a diamond in the sky.

When this blazing sun is gone,\
When he nothing shines upon,\
Then you show your little light,\
Twinkle, twinkle, through the night.

Then the traveler in the dark\
Thanks you for your tiny spark;\
He could not see where to go,\
If you did not twinkle so.

In the dark blue sky you keep,\
And often through my curtains peep,\
For you never shut your eye,\
Till the sun is in the sky.

As your bright and tiny spark,\
Lights the traveler in the dark,\
Though I know not what you are,\
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

[*Rhymes for the Nursery,* London: Darton and Harvey, 1806\
[https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/first-publication-of-twinkle-twinkle-little-star/](https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/first-publication-of-twinkle-twinkle-little-star)\
]{style="font-size: 10pt"}

Â 

This lullaby can be thought of as introducing nascent scientific
processes: noticing a phenomenon of interest (twinkle, twinkle, little
star), questioning (how I wonder what you are), observing (up above the
world so high) and starting to think about what one is seeing by making
an analogy (like a diamond in the sky). The poem also correlates
occurrences (when this blazing sun is gone...then you show your little
light...; for you never shut your eye, till the sun is in the sky), and
ponders what is not yet understood (though I know not what you are)
while celebrating again the phenomenon observed (twinkle, twinkle,
little star).

##### ***Question 5.4 How early in life does a child start noticing the sky?*** {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H54 style="text-align: center"}

#### *4. A young child's observations of the Moon in the sky: Joseph's Moon* {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H44}

Young children often notice what is happening in the sky, as described
by a graduate student below:

*Joseph is my nephew. At the time of this story, he was about 17 months
old...My father often takes care of Joseph and I think I was talking
about our moon assignments. My father said that he had recently taken
Joseph to the nearby park one afternoon and that Joseph had pointed and
said, "Moo." My father said he was looking for a cow (not a likely event
for this suburban park!)...*

*My father finally realized that Joseph was pointing at the sky and that
yes indeed there was a moon in the daytime sky. (When referring to the
moon at this time, Joseph would point and say, "Moo.") \[Hey! Could this
be a relationship between the moon and the cow who jumped over it??\]*

*At this point, my sister told a similar story. When Joseph pointed into
the daytime sky and said, "Moo," my sister said something like, "There's
no moon in the sky, it's daytime." Joseph was persistent though (not
that he could necessarily understand his mother yet) and finally brought
my sister to realize that there was a moon in the sky during daylight
hours. \[I'm not sure if Joseph is ready for Grad school yet, but I
think that during the fall semester, he made more moon observations than
some of the students in our class!\]*

*Some Reflections on the Moon \[Isn't this what causes the phases?\] and
Joseph:*

*I suppose what impresses me most is the awareness of a
one-and-a-half-year-old child of the moon. At this point in time there
seemed to be almost a fascination with the moon. We could say that this
is due to it's being a brightly lit object in a dark sky, but the moon
is much less obvious in the daytime sky. In fact, I often have to search
for the moon in the daytime sky; it usually doesn't just jump out at
you...*

*So adults with all their "experience" may take things for granted;
things that might not really be true. Joseph's mother and grandfather
both, by their comments, indicate that they were operating under the
rule "The moon only appears at night." Joseph seems to have straightened
them out on this point.*

*I believe that it is a good exercise for students to go back to the
basics of observation, to become like a child who has no preconceived
rules as to how the world works. All too often in the lab we manage to
get what we expect by writing off the "bad" points. In many cases in
science history those "bad" points weren't so bad after all and led to
advances in science. Â  Â  Â Â *

##### ***Question 5.5Â  How do people talk together about the Moon?*** {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H55 style="text-align: center"}

People all over the world see and talk about the moon. For the word for
*moon* in more than eighty languages see
<https://www.indifferentlanguages.com/words/moon> . Watching the moon
together can provide common ground for students from different cultures
to enjoy talking with and learning from one another. For information
about a global moon watching project, see
<http://www.worldmoonproject.org> or contact Professor Walter Smith at
<walter.smith@ttu.edu>.

#### *5. Ways of speaking about the Moon in a first-grade bilingual classroom* {#chapter-043-identifying-student-resources-5.html#U5H45}

A first-grade teacher, Deborah Roberts, described what happened when she
engaged her students in watching the moon:

*More than half of my class is enrolled in a bilingual program that is
part of the English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) program in
our school; many students wrote their moon journals in Spanish. Parents
helped with spelling, and some wrote what their child dictated. Parents
felt successful in helping their children in their native language
whether it was English or Spanish, and children felt successful in
observing the moon. Spanish-speaking students felt confident when
sharing their journal with the class. The English speakers were also
learning some Spanish; everyone knew luna meant moon and noche meant
night. So when someone shared their picture and their entry, anoche yo
vi la luna asÃ­ (last night I saw the moon like this), many non-Spanish
speakers understood part of the entry before they saw the picture.
Sometimes a Spanish-speaking child would teach the class how to say what
he or she wrote.*

Deborah Roberts. "The sky's the limit: Parents and first-grade students
observe the sk*y."Science and Children*, ***31***(1), 33-37. (September,
1999).

Some schools choose a theme each year for which all classes in all
grades contribute. Watching the moon sometimes has served this role as a
context within which students of all ages can participate.

Ongoing observations of the Sun and the Moon can provide evidence on
which to base development of a set of central ideas about the
Sun/Earth/Moon system. This process starts with looking up and making
observations of the sky on a regular basis. Also important is recording
those observations systematically in a sky journal.

### **A. Observing the shape and location of the Sun and the Moon in the sky** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H33}

During this course, try to look up whenever you are outside and check
out what is happening in the sky.

##### ***Question 5.6 Where is the Sun in the sky right now? How does the Sun seem to move across the sky?*** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H56 style="text-align: center"}

-   Make a *sky journal* in which to keep track of what you see.

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;padding: 5px;margin: 5px"}
Equipment: We use sky journals made by cutting four pieces of paper
(8.5" x 11") in half to make eight sheets (8.5" x 5.5"), folding those
sheets together in half to make pages (4.25" x 5.5") and stapling the
folded pages along the edge.
:::

-   The best way to start observing the sky is to go outside and have a
    look!\
    DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN! A direct stare at the Sun can
    damage eyes.
-   What do you expect to see in the sky?
-   Orient yourself with the *cardinal directions*: Where is North?
    East? South? West?
    -   [If not sure, where does the Sun seem to rise? That's
        East.]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}

    -   [What's left? (Where we live, that's
        North.)]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}

[You also can use a compass or think about how you get from where you
are to somewhere else that is in a known direction. Where we live, for
example, a freeway goes many miles directly north or directly south. One

Â 

-   While facing South, look up at the sky. What do you see?\
    (Where we live, maybe some clouds, airplanes, birds and during the

Physics student, Fall 2016

#### *2. Nuances about observing the sky* {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H47 style="text-align: center"}

Although the weather is often cloudy and rainy where we live, we have
clear skies during class time occasionally in the term. When this
occurs, we go outside, orient ourselves with respect to North, East,
South, and West, and make the first sky observation together, at least
of the Sun, and if we are fortunate, of the Moon as well. We think it is
important to model going on short field trips outside the classroom as a
normal part of learning experiences. Although it is best to do the first
observation outside as a class, one can discuss inside how to use the
sky journal if going outside is not feasible.

On the first sunny class day, we go outside to make an observation
together while looking at the sky. We act out estimating the angle that
an arm pointing at the Sun makes with the ground, [without looking
directly at the Sun!]{style="text-decoration: underline"} and discuss
placing a sketch of the Sun in the appropriate area of the page with
respect to its location in the sky. The student who made the observation
shown in Fig. 5.8 has not quite drawn the stick-figure-arm pointing
directly at the drawn Sun but is close. The arm pointing at the Moon
also is not shown pointing directly at the Moon. The student has labeled
the angle formed by pointing arms at the Sun and the Moon as 90 degrees,
a right angle, although the angle drawn is slightly bigger; if the arms
had been drawn pointing directly at the Sun and the Moon, the angle
would have been closer to 90 degrees. Although the sketch of the
half-lit Moon looks a bit more than half lit, all the necessary
information is there. Students' accuracy in making sketches usually
improves considerably with practice.

We start right away having students use this somewhat complex format for
recording observations in a systematic way. With a 15-week semester, one
can afford to say simply 'look for the Moon and record what you see.'
With this very general instruction, students likely will experience the
bewilderment of not finding the Moon very easily for a month before
starting a more systematic observation process. With only a 10-week
quarter term, however, we have shifted to this more structured approach
immediately. We also provide explicit suggestions for a good time to
look at the sky so that the students can start assembling a series of
observations of the Sun and the Moon within the first month of the term.

If poor weather interferes, we sometimes use a computer program to
simulate what would be seen if we could see beyond clouds and/or rain.
(see: <http://stellarium.org> for an open source version.) It is
important for students to become aware of changes in the shape of the
moon on at least a weekly basis.

### **B. Observing the Sun** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H34}

This section introduces several methods for documenting the Sun's
apparent motions and estimating its size.

##### ***Question 5.8 How does the Sun seem to move across the sky?*** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H58 style="text-align: center"}

There are several ways to document how the Sun seems to move across the
sky. As noted above, one can make multiple observations of the Sun's
position in the sky during the same day on a sky journal page. Be sure,
however, to [avoid looking directly at the
Sun!]{style="text-decoration: underline"} If feasible, observing where
the Sun seems to rise and set documents the beginning and end of the
Sun's apparent daily journey across the sky. There also are several
ways, based upon observing how the tip of the shadow of a vertical
*gnomon* changes during the day. The gnomon,Â such as a person, post,
vertical long leg of a paper clip or nail, should be perpendicular to
flat ground in an area likely to be sunny during the middle of the day.

#### *1. Observing where and when the Sun appears to rise and set.* {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H48}

To the extent possible, begin noticing where the Sun seems to be rising
and setting where you live:

Equipment: Use a pencil and piece of paper on a clipboard or cardboard.

-   Try to observe sunrise at least once a week. Face east and draw a
    profile of trees and buildings. For each observation at this
    location, indicate on the sunrise profile where and when the Sun
    seems to be rising along that profile.
-   Also try to observe sunset at least once a week. Face west and draw
    a similar profile of trees and buildings. For each observation at
    this location, indicate on the sunset profile where and when the Sun
    seems to be setting along that profile. Record the date and time for
    each observation.
-   How do rising and setting positions on the profile change over a
    week? Over several weeks? Months?
-   How do the times of sunrise and sunset change over a week? Over
    several weeks? Months?

#### *2. Observing a student gnomon's shadow during a field trip outside during a sunny class session* {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H49}

Go outside twice during a class session on a sunny day to document how
the sun seems to move across the sky. If possible, include an
observation at solar noon, when the Sun appears to be at its highest
angular altitude in the sky. DO NOT LOOK AT THE SUN!

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;text-align: left;margin: 5px;padding: 5px"}
Equipment: Use chalk, meter stick, protractor, and a video camera to
document a student's shadow and your group's thinking.
:::

-   -   Early in the session, choose one member of your group to stand
        so that the student's shadow falls upon the pavement. The
        student serves as the *gnomon* for this observation. A gnomon is
        a vertical object (stick, post, person) perpendicular to the
        ground whose shadow can be interpreted in terms of its length
        and the direction to which it is pointing. Other group members
        use chalk to draw the outline of this gnomon's shadow on the
        pavement.
    -   Draw an outline of the student's feet so that the student can
        stand in the same way in the same spot near the end of class as
        shown in Fig. 5.9.
    -   Measure the height H of the student gnomon and the length L of
        the shadow. Record the date and time of these measurements.
    -   How do you think the student's shadow will change by the end of
        class?
        -   Shorter or longer or the same length?
        -   Pointing further to the right? left? or in the same
            direction?
        -   Why do you think that?
    -   Mark on the pavement where you think the tip of the person's
        shadow head will fall by the end of class.
    -   Why do you think the tip of the shadow will fall there by the
        end of class? Use the video function of a camera or cell phone
        to record a group member briefly explaining the reasoning for
        the group's prediction for where the tip of the shadow's head
        will be on the pavement by the end of class.\

-   When back inside the classroom, make a sketch showing the Sun,
    student gnomon, shadow, and sunlight.
-   Also draw a careful ray diagram with straight lines representing the
    student gnomon, shadow, and ray of light from the Sun. Â Be sure to
    draw the lines representing the gnomon and shadow at right angles as
    shown in Fig. 5.10.
-   What was the angular altitude of the Sun, Angle Î± (alpha), at the

:::

-   Near the end of class, go outside again to observe where the tip of
    the student gnomon's shadow head is now. Mark the tip of the shadow
    and measure the shadow's new length. Record the new shadow length
    and time.
-   Make a sketch or take a photo of the gnomon and marked tips of the
    shadows of the gnomon's head.
-   Interpret the change in position of the tip of the student's shadow
    head in terms of how the Sun appears to have moved across the sky
    during the time period between observations. DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT
    THE SUN!
-   During the next class session: how did the Sun's angular altitude,
    AngleÂ Î±, change during these observations?
-   What is the connection between how long the student's shadow is and
    how high the Sun seems to be in the sky?
-   If it was possible to measure the length of the gnomon's shadow at
    solar noon, what was the Sun's maximum angular altitude, AngleÂ Î±, on
    this date?
-   Discuss as a whole group, each small group's observations and
    interpretations.
-   Formulate a central idea that articulates findings from this
    exploration of how the Sun seems to move across the sky during the
    day.

#### *3. Observing a post gnomon's shadow outside during a sunny day* {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H410}

Go on a field trip outside early in a class session on a sunny day to
observe the tip of a shadow cast by a post.Â DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE
SUN!

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;padding: 5px;margin: 5px"}
Equipment: Another option is to use chalk to mark the tip of a shadow of
a nearby vertical post on the pavement.
:::

-   Mark the tip regularly throughout the class session, perhaps every
    15 minutes, and if feasible throughout the day.

#### *4. Observing a paper clip or nail gnomon's shadow on a sunny day.* {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H411}

Another option is to make an apparatus for a portable shadow plot for
each group as shown in Fig. 5.11.

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;padding: 5px;margin: 5px"}
Equipment: Tape the four edges of a piece of paper to the outside of a
manila folder or cardboard. Bend a large paper clip so that a long leg
is bent perpendicular to the rest of the clip. The long leg is the
*gnomon.* Slip the paper clip on to the middle back edge of the manila
folder or cardboard so that the bent long leg is vertical. Tape the clip
in place.

Or pound a nail through a thick piece of cardboard or board so that it
is perpendicular to the plane of the board.

-   If feasible, instructor starts shadow plot observations for each
    group as early in a sunny day as feasible.
-   On a fieldtrip outside, students gather around a suitable sidewalk
    crack or wall that forms an East/West line. DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT
    THE SUN! The instructor demonstrates what to do:
    -   Line up a shadow plot apparatus with the east/west crack in
        sidewalk or on the wall
    -   Invite a student to mark the tip of the shadow of the gnomon and
        label it with the date and time
-   Each small group:
    -   A member from each group marks the tip of the gnomon's shadow on
        the group's shadow plot and labels with the time.
    -   Other members of each group mark the tip of the gnomon's shadow
        on the group's shadow plot in given time intervals (such as 15
        minutes) and just before all go back inside
    -   Members of each group decide when each will briefly leave class
        andÂ take their portable gnomon outside to mark the tip of the
        shadow at given time intervals until the end of class.
-   All go outside near the end of class to make last shadow plot
    observations.
-   Interpret the change in position of the tip of the *gnomon's* shadow
    in terms of how the Sun appears to have moved across the sky during
    the time period of observations.
-   If feasible, instructor continues shadow plot observations for the
    groups' portable gnomons until the end of the day.
-   During the next session, discuss as a whole group each small group's
    observations and interpretations.
-   Formulate a central idea that articulates findings from this
    exploration of how the Sun seems to move across the sky during the
    day.
-   If feasible, make shadow plots near the beginning and end of a
    course and consider differences in shadow plots made at different
    times, particularly if observations have been made near an equinox
    and near a solstice. Try to identify the moment of "shortest
    shadow," which is known as *solar noon* and to compare the Sun's
    maximum angular altitude, AngleÂ Î±, at different times during the
    term.

to it on the center of one of the long sides of the paper. We placed the
piece of paper with the paperclip facing towards us on the sidewalk so
that the corner of the paper was lined up to lines in the sidewalk. We
then marked a dot where the shadow of the paperclip ended on the paper
every 15 minutes, starting at the beginning of class and going until the
end of class. I observed that the dots on the paper started on the left
and moved closer to the center of the paper as time went on. I also
observed that the dots began to get closer together as time went on.*

Sun is in the southern sky at noon, so this student's long morning
shadow became shorter in length and shifted in direction toward North.
One way to find North if lost is to observe the shadow of a vertical
stick during a sunny day and identify the direction the shortest shadow
is pointing.
(See:Â <https://adventure.howstuffworks.com/survival/wilderness/true-north2.htm>
) .

-   If feasible, compare shadow plots made near the equinoxes (March or
    September) with those made near the solstices (June or December).*\

##### ***Question 5.9 How big is the Sun?*** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H59 style="text-align: center"}

If one glances at the sky when the Sun and Moon are both visible, an
easy comparison to make is that the Sun and Moon appear to be about the
same size. DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN!

To estimate the actual size of the Sun, however, we used pinhole
phenomena in Unit 1, VI. If not undertaken in earlier class sessions, on
a sunny day make the observations outlined for Question 1.16 to estimate
the diameter of the Sun.

::: {.textbox}
To estimate the diameter of the Sun: As shown in Fig. 1.21 (repeated),
this involves making a pinhole in a sheet of aluminum foil held tight in
a cardboard frame; making a cardboard screen covered with a sheet of
white paper, using a meter stick to separate the pinhole and the screen,
tracing the projection of the sun through the pinhole on the screen, and
measuring the diameter of the projection.

Use the mathematics that describes pinhole phenomena to estimate the
Sun's diameter:

Â 

![\\begin{split}\\frac{W}{D} & = \\frac{w}{d} \\\\ \\frac{\\text{Width
(diameter) of the sun}}{\\text{Distance of the sun from the pinhole}} &
= \\frac{\\text{width (diameter) of the projection}}{\\text{distance of

pinhole}}\\end{split}](OEBPS/assets/5fd2bad05555330a3ed65462a85668b0.png "\begin{split}\frac{W}{D} & = \frac{w}{d} \\ \frac{\text{Width (diameter) of the sun}}{\text{Distance of the sun from the pinhole}} & = \frac{\text{width (diameter) of the projection}}{\text{distance of projection from the pinhole}}\end{split}"){.latex
.mathjax}

Solve for the width (diameter) of the Sun, measure the width (diameter)
of the Sun's projection when one meter away from a pinhole, and assume
the Sun is about 100,000,000 miles from the Earth. (Note that it is not
necessary to convert meters to miles to calculate this estimate.)

#### *1. Examples of a group's initial questions and findings about the Moon* {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H413}

A student reported the following after the first week of looking for the
Moon and comparing observations on March 29 at 9:30 am and April 1 at
8:52 am as shown in Fig. 5.14.

*An initial question that came to mind when making observations was,
does the angle between the sun and the moon change at all?*

*As we can see from the first few observations...the angle present in
the first observation is obtuse while angle measure of the third is more
acute. This shows that the angle has gotten smaller since the day of our
first observation.*

separated by several days.
:::
:::

Physics student, Spring 2016

This student reported the following questions and conclusions from this
first week of observing:

*When we first saw the moon during class, it was large and was about
half-lit on the left, the side the sun was on, and pretty high above the
horizon.Â  Some questions I had on that first day were: Will the moon
always be lit on the side the sun is closest to? Will the lit part of
the moon be bigger or smaller? Will the moon be in a different place
tomorrow, next week, and/or next month?Â *

*I have already found the answers to some of these initial questions
through my observations of the moon, and thus claims about the moon.Â 
First, I have found that the moon, when visible, is lit on the side
closest to the sun.Â  Therefore, I can make the claim that the moon is
lit by the sun.Â  Second, I have found the lit part of the moon does
change size, and it appeared to be a little smaller each day.Â  I have
yet to find a powerful idea for this observation, as I am unsure of what
causes the shaded part of the moon.Â  Is it a shadow from the earth, or
just that part of the moon is facing away from the sun?Â  The third
question was answered as well, as the moon was in a slightly different
location each day, with the angle of my arms getting smaller.Â  This has
led me to make the claim that the moon is always moving.*

Another physics student, Spring 2016

#### *2. Nuances about asking questions, making observations, and reporting findings* {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H414}

Both students made the same claim verbally that the angle formed by
pointing one arm at the Sun and the other arm at the Moon got smaller
between March 29 and April 1. The angle shown by the first student for
March 29 is clearly obtuse, however, whereas the angle shown by the
second student for this date looks like a right angle. The angle shown
by the first student for April 1 is clearly acute whereas the angle
shown by the second student for this date still looks like a right
angle. The sketch of the Moon shown by the first student for March 29 is
more than half lit on the left and shows only the lit portion, whereas
the second student stated that the moon was "about half lit on the left"
and sketched both the lit and the inferred dark portions of the Moon.
This student noted on the sky journal that the Moon appeared to be about
one third lit for the later observation.

Compared across all members of the class, these early observations
typically differ in the angles drawn for the arms, shapes drawn for the
lit portion of the Moon, and placement of the sketch of the Moon in the
sky as well as questions asked and claims made. It is important for
group members to have time in class to compare their sky journal
observations, to become aware of differences in both sketching and
thinking. By discussing such differences among themselves, the students
typically become more accurate and detailed when making their
observations.

Students often come up with questions, experimental designs for making
observations, and interpretations of findings that need refinement. Note
that scientists do this as well; part of *doing science* is realizing
the need to revise what one is asking, to enhance how one is making
observations, and/or to reconsider initial interpretations of the data
obtained. Therefore, we do not step in to warn about possible problems
in making observations nor comment on interpretations that reflect
inaccurate initial drawings.

The intent of this open-ended process is for students to experience both
overcoming the pitfalls and enjoying the pleasures characteristic of
doing science. A plan to make observations at a time when the Moon will
not be visible, for example, will delay gathering data about how the
Moon appears, but likely will prompt a new question about when the Moon
can be seen. A plan to look for the Moon at 6 p.m. seems reasonable,
until one has gone out to look and not seen the Moon even though the sky
is clear. This may be because the Moon is not yet above the horizon or
it may be that the Moon is above the horizon but the lit portion of the
Moon is not visible to the viewer. When students report such a finding,
we encourage them to be careful in their language, to state they that
"did not see the Moon" rather than that "the Moon was not there."

If students see the Moon but record what they saw later, rather than
while looking at the Moon, they may not sketch the shape of the lit
portion accurately. We do not comment if we see a sketch of a Moon lit
on the right, however, when we know the Moon was lit on the left in the
sky; we also do not comment if a sketch of a Moon that is more than half
lit looks like a cookie with a bite out of it
![](OEBPS/assets/Fig-5.xa_.png){.alignnone .wp-image-268 width="20"
height="17"} instead of like a football
![](OEBPS/assets/Fig-5.xb_.png){.alignnone .wp-image-269 width="20"
height="13"}. Group members likely will question those observations and
prompt a commitment to draw what one is seeing while looking at the Moon
rather than drawing later while trying to remember what one saw.

We also initially do not impose vocabulary on observations such as the
traditional names for the various phases of the Moon. The descriptive
term *half-lit Moon* is acceptable and delays the issue of why such a
Moon is called a *Quarter Moon* until the students have enough knowledge
from watching the Moon to understand the appropriateness of this
designation.

Our experience has been that when students look for the Moon
consistently and make observations with only their own concerns about
whether these are correctly drawn and labeled, their observations
gradually become more accurate without needing critique from an
instructor. They also often begin to experience the fun of puzzling
about what they are seeing, talking with colleagues about their
puzzlements, and making predictions about what will happen next.

    -   When would be a good time to look for the Moon next?
    -   What shape do you think the lit portion of the Moon will be the
        next time you see the Moon?
    -   What type of angle do you think will be formed by pointing at
        the Sun and the Moon when both are visible? (Acute? Right?

    members as they have been making observations of the Moon.
    -   Are there any differences in your observations that need
        resolving?
    -   Are there any similarities that can be articulated as new claims
        that need confirming?
-   Generate a new question about the Moon with your group members.\
    The question should be something you can explore by looking at the
    Moon in the sky rather than by reading books or searching the

-   Begin to use the traditional names for the various shapes of the lit
    portion of the Moon: *crescent* when less than half lit, *quarter*
    when half lit although this nomenclature may be puzzling, *gibbous*
    when more than half lit, *full* when fully lit. Also consider
    whether the phases are *waxing,* becoming more lit, or *waning,*
    becoming less lit.

FIG. 5.17 Student's Observations, April 17-23, 2016
:::
:::

***Stating current question and findings.** The question that I am now
exploring with my small group members is, how does the appearance of the
moon change in regards to how it is lit and shaded? My role in this
exploration is looking for and observing the moon every evening at 8
p.m., which is right before sunset. My procedure is to look for the moon
wherever I happen to be at 8 p.m., and then record what I see on my sky
calendar. I am finding that the lit part on the right side of the moon
increased until the moon was full, which can be seen in my observations
above. Since April 17, the lit part on the right side of the moon has
been gradually increasing until the moon became full, which I observed
on April 22.*

***Confirming or disconfirming earlier findings*** ***.*** *One of my
previous claims was that the angle between the sun and the moon changes.
These new observations support this claim because the angle between the
sun and the moon has been increasing. In just these new observations, a
right angle is seen on April 17, an obtuse angle is seen on April 18-20,
and a straight angle is seen on April 21-22. This shows that the angle
between the sun and the moon is changing.*

*Another previous claim is that the curve of the line separating the
bright and the shadowed parts of the moon changes shape. This claim is
supported by this next set of observations because the arch of the line
is continually changing as the moon becomes more lit, as seen in the
observations in Figure (5.17). Another previous claim is that the side
of the moon that is lit up changes. This is also supported by my new
observations because in previous observations, the lit part was on the
left side of the moon, but in these observations, the lit part is on the
right side of the moon.*

*One last previous claim was that there is a period of time when the
entire moon is shadowed. These new observations do not support this
claim because I had no observation above in which the entire moon was
shadowed.*

***Summarizing patterns in what we have been seeing.*** *I am c*
*omparing four weeks of data.*

***Summarizing changes in the shape of the Moon so far.** At the
beginning of the term, the left part of the moon was lit, as seen on
March 29. The lit part on the left side of the moon continued to
decrease until the entire moon was shaded. Then, I could see the moon
again on April 9, when the lit part of the moon was now on the right
side. The lit part on the right side of the moon continued to increase
until there was a full moon that was seen on April 22. So, it seems as
though the moon is partially lit, the lit part decreases until the
entire moon is shaded, then the other side of the moon is partially lit,
and finally, the lit part increases until the entire moon is lit.*

***Summarizing changes in the angle formed by pointing one arm at the
Sun and one arm at the Moon so far**. At the beginning of the term, the
angle between the sun and the moon was an acute angle, as seen on March
30. As the term went on, the angle increased. It became a right angle on
April 17, an obtuse angle on April 18, and a straight angle on April
21.*

***Summarizing changes in the location of the Moon in the sky**. The
moon appears to move only slightly on the same day over several hours. I
first looked at 8 p.m., then 9 p.m., then 10 p.m. on April 18. The moon
seemed to slowly get higher up in the sky as time went on, but only
slightly.*

*I have observed the moon at 8 p.m. over several days. The moon appears
to be moving more and more east in the sky. The observations above from
April 17-April 22 show that the moon is gradually moving from the west
to the east when observed at 8 p.m. each night.*

***Summarizing changes in the times when the Moon is visible so far**.
At the beginning of the term, the moon was visible in the morning. On
March 29, I saw the moon at 9:29 a.m. and on March 30, I saw the moon at
7:42 a.m. As the term went on, I could no longer see the moon in the
morning, such as when I looked on April 3 at 9:39 a.m. and did not see
the moon. I began to look right before sunset and I could see the moon.
On April 15, I could see the moon at 8:00 p.m. So, at the beginning of
the term, the moon was visible in the morning and now it is visible in
the evening and at night.*

***Making predictions.****I predict that the angle between the sun and
the moon will become acute again because the angle started as acute,
became right, became obtuse, and then became straight. So, I think that
the cycle will continue and that the angle formed will be acute again. I
think that the moon will be more towards the west in the sky at 8 p.m.
The moon moved more and more east in the sky each day at 8 p.m., so I
think that it will start to move more west again. I also predict that
the right side of the moon will start to become shaded and that the
shaded part of the moon will continue to increase, since that is what I
saw happen to the shaded part of the moon during the first week of the
term*.

#### *2. Nuances about observing the Moon* {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H416}

After observing the Moon for several weeks, most of the students begin
to notice and comment upon details that puzzle them. Several, for
example, likely will have noticed already the intriguing phenomena
raised in Question 5.13, of the Moon seeming to move across the sky from
east to west during several hours but from west to east during several
days. At this point in the exploration, this becomes a whole class
rather than small group question, with the emphasis on everyone
verifying these observations.

This intent is made explicit, that when something quite surprising
arises, it is helpful to have multiple observations of the effect by
different groups to be sure that the surprising effect is replicable.
Therefore, all students should have observations of their own that the
Moon seems to move east to west over several hours but from west to east
over several days. In order to understand *why* this puzzling behavior
of the Moon occurs, the students first need to develop central ideas
about the Moon based on all the observations they have been gathering,
then use these central ideas to develop an explanation. These summaries
are tentative interpretations of observations to date. After another set
of observations where patterns seem to begin repeating, students will
have enough data to make some strong claims about the Sun and the Moon.

### **E. Identifying patterns based on evidence** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H37}

##### ***Question 5.15 What pattern have you observed in the changing shape of the Moon?*** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H515 style="text-align: center"}

-   Compare your observations with your group members' observations.
-   When you group has agreed on the pattern of changes in the shape of
    the lit portion of the moon, draw the shapes on a large white board
    in order as they appeared in the sky.Draw the outline of a shape
    with a black marker; let the white of whiteboard be the filler that
    represents the lit portion.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Write the traditional name of each shape underneath. These are
    called the *phases of the Moon.* A traditional order is to list them
    as new (not seen), waxing crescent, 1st quarter, waxing gibbous,
    full, waning gibbous, 3rd quarter, and waning crescent.
-   What is the shape of the lit portion associated with each phase of
    the Moon?
-   What is the pattern of how the shape of the lit portion of the Moon
    seems to change?

##### ***Question 5.16 What pattern have you observed in the angle formed by pointing arms at the Sun and Moon when both are visible?*** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H516 style="text-align: center"}

-   Under each phase, draw stick figures with arms forming the kind of
    angle observed.\
    (Acute? Right? Obtuse? Straight?)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   What is the pattern of how this angle seems to change?

##### ***Question 5.17 How are the changing shape of the Moon and the changing angle related?*** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H517 style="text-align: center"}

-   Based on the evidence of your observations, make and support a
    central idea about the way the shape of the lit portion of the Moon
    seems to change during its phases.
-   Based on the evidence of your observations, make and support a
    central idea about the way the angle formed by pointing at both the
    Sun and the Moon seems to change.
-   Based on the evidence of your observations, make and support a
    central idea about the connection between the shape of the lit
    portion of the Moon and the angle formed by pointing at both the Sun
    and the Moon.

##### ***Question 5.18 What pattern have you observed in the relation of the lit side of the Moon and the location of the Sun?*** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H518 style="text-align: center"}

-   Based on the evidence of your observations, make and support a
    central idea about the relation between the lit side of the Moon and
    the position of the Sun in the sky.

### **F. Making predictions for when a phase of the Moon will rise and set** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H38}

##### ***Question 5.19 How can you predict when a phase of the Moon will rise, transit, and set?*** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H519 style="text-align: center"}

It is a lot easier to observe the Moon systematically if one can predict
when and where to look for the Moon in the sky.

#### *1. Creating a Sun clock and using it to predict when the Moon will rise, transit, and set* {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H417}

One way to make predictions for rising and setting times for the Moon is
to use the angle that the Moon seems to make with the Sun as seen from
Earth. To do so, one needs to identify specific positions of the Sun
with particular times.

-   Create a *sun clock* as shown in Fig. 5.18 by drawing a circle with
    a horizontal diameter.
    -   If observing in the northern hemisphere, label the left end of
        the diameter East and the right end West.
    -   Also label the left end of the diameter as "rising position for
        the Sun"
    -   Label the top of the circle "transiting position for the Sun"
    -   Also label the right end of the diameter as "setting position
        for the Sun"

Fig. 5.18 Model of a Sun Clock with rising, transiting, and setting
positions as seen in the northern hemisphere. (If observing in the
southern hemisphere, label the rising position, East, on the right and
the setting position, West, on the left.)
:::
:::

The arc of the circle above the diameter from East (rising position) to
top of the circle (transiting position) to West (setting position)
represents day, when the Sun is above the horizon. In this model of a
sun clock, as shown in Fig. 5.18, we are envisioning the Sun moving
along the top half of the circle, rising in the East, moving high across
the sky, and setting in the West all in a *clockwise* direction as seen
from the northern hemisphere or counterclockwise as seen from the
southern hemisphere.

The arc of the circle below the diameter from West (setting position) to
bottom of the circle to East (rising position) represents night, when
the Sun is not visible. In this model of a sun clock, we are envisioning
the Sun continuing to move along the bottom half of the circle, setting
in the west, moving along the bottom of the circle during the night, and
rising in the east. We are not claiming that the Sun actually does this,
only that we can envision such a model.

-   Ignore daylight saving time and assume times appropriate for
    equinoxes (late March, late September) when the Sun rises at about 6
    a.m., is high in the sky (transiting) at about noon, and sets at
    about 6 p.m. Label the sun clock with these times for the Sun at
    these positions. Assume the position of the Sun at the bottom of the
    circle would be at midnight, 12:00 a.m. Also indicate about where
    the Sun would be at intermediate times, such as 9 a.m., 3 p.m., 9
    p.m., and 3 a.m. Note that this sun clock represents a way of
    envisioning where the Sun seems to be located in the sky (or not in
    the sky) over a 24-hour period.

-   How is this 24-hour sun clock similar to the traditional 12-hour
    clock one sometimes sees on walls and watches? How is it different?

-   Now use the sun clock to predict rising, transiting, and setting
    times for each phase of the Moon. Start with a phase for which an
    easy angle is formed by pointing at the Sun and the Moon. Start, for
    example, with a First Quarter Moon. When does a first quarter Moon
    rise? Transit? Set?

-   You now have a tool for predicting when and where to look for the
    Moon during any phase.\
    Use this tool to predict rising, transiting, and setting times for
    all the phases of the Moon: new moon, waxing crescent, first
    quarter, waxing gibbous, full, waning gibbous, third quarter, and
    waning crescent.

quarter Moon as well as an example summary of central ideas about the
Sun and the Moon.

#### *2. Example of student work illustrating how to predict rising, transiting, and setting times* *for a first quarter Moon.* {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H418}

*To be able to determine where the moon will be at specific times, one
can develop and utilize aÂ  'sun clock'. The sun clock is able to 'tell
time' based on where the sun seems to be in the sky (or below the
horizon) over 24 hours. For example, if you were looking for a 1st
quarter moon, we know the angle between the sun and the moon is 90
degrees and the moon is lit on the right. Therefore, by putting your
right arm towards the sun, 90 degrees behind that is where the moon will
be. Therefore, the 1st quarter moon will rise at 12 pm, will be high in
the sky at 6 pm, and will be setting at midnight as shown in the figure
(5.20).*

Â 

*During the week of April 17, I looked for the moon at 8pm, which is
right before sunset. The lit part of the moon was on the right and it
continued to increase until there was a full moon on April 22. The angle
between the sun and the moon continued to increase, changing from an
obtuse angle into a straight angle. When there was a full moon, the
angle between the sun and the moon was a straight angle. Since then, I
have not been able to see the moon due to it being cloudy.*

***Developing Central Ideas Based on Evidence***

*This section will discuss ideas about the moon, as well as the evidence
that supports those ideas. (Figure 5.22) is a chart made in class. Each
row of this table presents a different idea. Those ideas will be
discussed below.*

FIG. 5.22 Student's entries in a table summarizing findings about the
phases of the Moon.
:::
:::

***The shape of the lit portion of the Moon that we see from Earth
changes in a regular pattern.*** *There are 8 different phases of the
moon. In the New Moon phase, the moon is completely shaded, so there is
no lit portion of the moon that we see.*

*In the Waxing Crescent phase, there is a growing small portion, (say
about Â¼), on the right side of the moon that is lit.*

*In the First Quarter phase, the right half of the moon is lit.*

*In the Waxing Gibbous phase, there is a growing big portion, (say about
Â¾), on the right side of the moon that is lit.*

*In the Full Moon phase, the entire moon is lit.*

*In the Waning Gibbous phase, there is a decreasing big portion, (say
about Â¾), on the left side of the moon that is lit.*

*In the Third Quarter phase, the left half of the moon is lit.*

*In the Waning Crescent phase, there is a decreasing small portion, (say
about Â¼), on the left side of the moon that is lit.*

*A general description of the pattern observed is that the moon is
completely shaded and then the right side of the moon slowly becomes
more and more lit until the entire moon is lit. After the entire moon is
lit, the right side of the moon slowly becomes more and more shaded
until the entire moon is shaded again.*

***The angle formed by pointing one arm at the Moon and one arm at the
Sun changes in a regular pattern related to the changing shape of the
lit portion of the Moon that we see.*** *The stick figures in the chart
above have one arm pointing at the moon and one arm pointing at the sun.
The arms make an appropriate angle for each phase. There is a different
figure for each of the phases.*

*In the New Moon phase, there is a 0Â° angle between the moon and the
sun.*

*In the Waxing Crescent phase, there is an acute angle between the moon
and the sun.*

*In the First Quarter phase, there is a right angle between the moon and
the sun.*

*In the Waxing Gibbous phase, there is an obtuse angle between the moon
and the sun.*

*In the Full Moon phase, there is a straight angle between the moon and
the sun.*

*In the Waning Gibbous phase, there is an obtuse angle between the sun
and the moon.*

*In the Third Quarter phase, there is a right angle between the sun and
the moon.*

*In the Waning Crescent phase, there is an acute angle between the sun
and the moon.*

*A general description of the pattern observed between this angle and
the lit portion of the moon we see is that the greater the lit portion
of the moon, the greater the angle between the sun and the moon. The
smaller the lit portion of the moon, the smaller the angle between the
sun and the moon.*

***The lit side of the Moon is always on the same side as the Sun.***
*There are several observations that support this claim. On March 29 at
9:30 am, I observed that the sun was on the left side of the moon and
the lit part of the moon was on the left.*

*On April 2 at 9:15 am, I observed that the sun was on the left side of
the moon and the lit part of the moon was on the left.*

*On April 11 at 7:45 am, I observed that the sun was on the right side
of the moon and the lit part of the moon was on the right.*

*On April 19, at 8:00 pm, I observed that the sun was on the right side
of the moon and the lit part of the moon was on the right.*

*A summary of this pattern is that when the sun is on the right side of
the moon, the right side of the moon is lit and when the sun is on the
left side of the moon, the left side on the moon is lit.*

***The angle formed by pointing one arm at the Moon and one arm at the
Sun is useful for predicting when and where to look for the Moon.***
*Figure (5.23) is a model of a sun clock.*

*This sun clock can be used to generate predictions for rising,
transiting (high in the sky), and setting times for various phases of
the moon as shown in Table (V.2). We can use the sun to tell
approximately what time it is. The suns above the horizon represent
where we see the sun at certain times and the suns below the horizon
represent where we can envision the sun being located at certain times.
This allows us to use the sun as a 24-hour clock.*

FIG. 5.23 Student's sketch for a sun clock.
:::
:::

*Since the moon rises on the East side of the horizon, in the same
position of the sun at 6 am on the sun clock, we can use the angle
between the sun and the moon to predict about the time that the moon
rises. For example, during a First Quarter phase, there is a right angle
between the sun and the moon, with the sun on the right side of the
moon. So, looking at the sun clock, you look at what time the sun makes
a right angle with the 6 am time, with the sun on the right side of the
moon. The sun makes a right angle with the 6 am time at the 12 pm time,
so during a First Quarter phase, the moon rises at 12 pm.*

*During a Waning Crescent phase, there is an acute angle between the sun
and the moon, with the sun on the left side of the moon. So, looking at
the sun clock, you look at what time the sun makes an acute angle with
the 6 am time, with the sun on the left side of the moon. The sun makes
an acute angle with the 6 am time at about 3am, so during a Waning
Crescent phase, the moon rises at about 3 am, or sometime between 12 am
and 6 am.*

*Since the moon transits high in the sky, in the same position of the
sun at 12 pm on the sun clock, we can use the angle between the sun and
the moon to predict about the time that the moon transits. For example,
during a Full Moon, there is a straight angle between the sun and the
moon, with the sun on the right side of the moon. So, looking at the sun
clock, you look at what time the sun makes a straight angle with the 12
pm time, with the sun on the right side of the moon. The sun makes a
straight angle with the 12 pm time at the 12 am time, so during a Full
Moon, the moon transits at 12 am.*

*During a Waning Gibbous moon, there is an obtuse angle between the sun
and the moon, with the sun on the left side of the moon. So, looking at
the sun clock, you look at what time the sun makes an obtuse angle with
the 12 pm time, with the sun on the left side of the moon. The sun makes
an obtuse angle with the 12 pm time at about 3 am, so during a Waning
Gibbous moon, the moon transits at about 3 am, or between 12 am and 6
am.*

*Since the moon sets on the West side of the horizon, in the same
position of the sun at 6 pm on the sun clock, we can use the angle
between the sun and the moon to predict about the time that the moon
sets. For example, during a Waning Crescent phase, there is an acute
angle between the sun and the moon, with the sun on the left side of the
moon. So, looking at the sun clock, you look at what time the sun makes
an acute angle with the 6 pm time, with the sun on the left side of
where the moon is. The sun makes an acute angle with the 6 pm time at
about the 3 pm time, so during a Waning Crescent phase, the moon sets at
about 3 pm, or between 12 pm and 6 pm.*

*During a New Moon phase, there is a 0Â° angle between the sun and the
moon. So, looking at the sun clock, the moon and the sun will be in the
same location in the sky. This means that during a New Moon phase, the
new Â moon sets at 6 pm.*

***The Moon is visible at different times, depending on its phase.***
*Waxing moons are mostly visible during the day and some of the night,
from about 9:00 am to 3:00 am, depending on whether it is a Waxing
Crescent or a Waxing Gibbous moon. Full moons are mostly visible from
the evening to the early morning, from about 6:00 pm to 6:00 am.*

*Waning moons are mostly visible during the night and morning, from
about 9:00 pm to 3:00 pm, depending on whether it is a Waning Gibbous or
a Waning Crescent moon. Based on my observations, there was a Third
Quarter moon on March 31 at 9:32 am. There was a New Moon from April 5
until around April 8, at least the Moon was not visible although the sky
was clear. There was a First Quarter moon on April 15 at 8 pm. There was
a Full Moon on April 22 at 8 pm. It has been too cloudy for me to see
the moon recently, but I predict that there was a Third Quarter moon
recently in the past day or two. Through my observations, I learned that
a full cycle takes about a month. Next, I predict that the shaded part
of the moon will continue to increase until there is a new moon.*

*My observations can support the claims mentioned in (Fig. 5.22). I
observed a new moon around April 7 when I looked for the moon in the
morning and in the night and it was not visible, even though the sky was
clear.*

*I observed a Waxing Crescent moon on April 11 at 7:45 pm and the angle
between the sun and the moon was acute.*

*I observed a First Quarter moon on April 15 at 8:00 pm and the angle
between the sun and the moon was right.*

*I observed a Waxing Gibbous moon on April 18 at 8:00 pm and the angle
between the sun and the moon was obtuse.*

*I observed a full moon on April 22 at 8:00 pm and the angle between the
sun and the moon was straight.*

*I observed a Third Quarter moon on March 31 at 9:32 am and the angle
between the sun and the moon was right.*

*I observed a Waning Crescent moon on April 2 at 9:15 am and the angle
between the sun and the moon was acute.*

*I have not yet observed a Waning Gibbous moon. According to my
observations, there should have been one recently, but it has been
cloudy the past week, which made it so I couldn't see the moon. I should
try to observe the Waning Gibbous moon a few days after the next full
moon, between around9:00 pm and 9:00 am*.

Also consider the durations of the various phases of the Moon, their
connections to the format of calendars, and ways in which this process
of developing ideas about the phases of the Moon, based on evidence, has
modeled the nature of science.

##### ***Question 5.20 What is the duration of each phase of the Moon?*** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H520 style="text-align: center"}

-   There are eight phases of the Moon. Do the phases occur at a
    particular instant or over a period of time?
    -   [New: an instant, when angle = 0
        degrees]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}
    -   [Waxing crescent: during an increasing acute angle between 0Âº
        and 90Âº, about a week]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}
    -   [First quarter, an instant, when angle = 90
        degrees]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}
    -   [Waxing gibbous, during an increasing obtuse angle between 90Âº
        and 180Âº, about a week]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}
    -   [Full, an instant, when angle = 180
        degrees]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}
    -   [Waning gibbous, during a decreasing obtuse angle between 180Âº
        and 90Âº (or increasing between 180Âº and 270Âº), about a
        week]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}
    -   [Third quarter, an instant, when angle = 90Âº (or
        270Âº).]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}
    -   [Waning crescent, during a decreasing acute angle (or increasing
        between 270Âº and 360Âº), about a week]{style="color: #a6a6a6"}
-   The phases begin to repeat in about 29.5 days. Why do we have
    "weeks" in our calendar? "months"? (See
    <https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/days/7-days-week.html>Â )

##### ***Question 5.21 What aspects of the nature of science have students experienced so far?*** {#chapter-044-developing-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-5.html#U5H521 style="text-align: center"}

Table V.1 summarizes observations and interpretations based on a full
cycle of the Moon's phases. The students generated and explored their
own questions as well as issues guided by the instructor and course
curriculum. The process was incremental, with on-going daily
observations, brief discussions during many class sessions, homework
assignments to report new data and interpretations, and a culminating
session in which small groups developed central ideas about the Sun and
the Moon based on the accumulated evidence. The students then used a
model of the relation between the Sun and the Moon as seen from Earth to
make predictions for rising, transiting, and setting times for each
phase of the Moon.

This was a long process, at least five weeks with considerable time and
effort. Was it worth it? There are computer programs that students can
use to simulate the entire sequence of the Moon's changing phases within
a much shorter time period by gathering data from the computer rather
than from the sky. From our perspective, when weather permits, engaging
students in actually looking for the Moon in the sky over this extended
time period is preferable. This process models the nature of science in
sharpening skills in recording observations accurately, generating
questions of interest based on these observations, looking for patterns
in the data, discussing various interpretations, and using those to make
predictions of when and where to see the moon to maximize the likelihood
of observing the phenomena being studied.

The central ideas about the Sun and the Moon, based on observational
evidence, provide the basis for the next step: developing explanatory
models for three interconnected phenomena: day and night, the phases of
the moon, and the Earth's seasons. This extended experience throughout
the term is intended to foster deeper understandings of the
Sun/Earth/Moon system as well as of the nature of science and perhaps a
greater sense of satisfaction whenever the students see the Moon
throughout their lives.

This section develops two models for explaining the daily observation
that when the Sun is above the horizon, during *day,* one can see
things, one's world outside is well lit; after the Sun is below the
horizon, during *night*, one's world outside is dark unless illuminated
by artificial lighting.

##### ***Question 5.22 Why does it get dark at night?*** {#chapter-045-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-two-explanatory-models-for-day-and-night.html#U5H522 style="text-align: center"}

Two models offer explanations for why it gets dark at night: the *Fixed
Earth, Revolving Sun modelÂ * and the *Fixed Sun, Rotating Earth model*.

### **A. Developing the *Fixed Earth, Revolving Sun* explanatory model for day and night** {#chapter-045-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-two-explanatory-models-for-day-and-night.html#U5H39}

What does the Sun seem to be doing during a day and night? One can
observe the Sun seem to rise in the east in the early morning, climb in
an arc until high in the sky at about noon, continue to move across the
sky while sinking in an arc, and set in the west before it gets dark at
night.

After the sun sets, the sky is dark for many hours. One cannot see where
the Sun seems to have gone at night. Â One could infer, however, that the
Sun continues its daily journey of revolving in an arc around the other
side of the Earth.

This Earth-centered perspective, with the Sun revolving daily around a
fixed Earth, is also known as a *geocentric* model as shown in Fig.
5.24. Â The prefix *geo-* refers to the Earth and *centric* refers to
something that is at the center, something around which other things
revolve.

These all reflect a model of the Sun revolving daily around a fixed
Earth.

This is a very helpful model**!** We used it ourselves, along with the
angle formed by pointing one arm at the Sun and the other arm at the
Moon, to make predictions about when and where to look for each phase of
the Moon. To make a sun clock, we labeled the positions where we see the
Sun in the sky with the associated times and continued the pattern of
such associated times when we envisioned the Sun continuing to move in a
circle below the horizon as shown in Fig. 5.23 (repeated).

People have believed in this model, that the Earth is at rest in the
center of the universe, for thousands of years. Aristotle, a Greek
philosopher (384 BC -- 322 BC), for example, built upon earlier ideas by
Plato and Eudoxus to propose that the Moon, Sun, planets, and fixed
stars all revolve around the Earth on a series of concentric transparent
crystalline spheres.Â  (see:
<http://www.pas.rochester.edu/~blackman/ast104/aristotle8.html>).

Ptolemy, a Greek astronomer who lived in Egypt during the 2nd century
(85-165 AD), tried to summarize everything known about astronomy at that
time. He presented a complex mathematical Earth-centered model that
predicted well the motions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars (see:
<http://www.polaris.iastate.edu/EveningStar/Unit2/unit2_sub1.htm>). His
writings, a series of books known as the *Almagest*, were accepted for
about 1400 years.

### **B. Developing the *Fixed Sun, Rotating Earth* explanatory model for day and night** {#chapter-045-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-two-explanatory-models-for-day-and-night.html#U5H310}

An alternative model is harder to envision. How might the Earth be
moving that makes the Sun [seem]{style="text-decoration: underline"} to
be revolving daily around the Earth? If a lamp representing the Sun is
fixed in place, how can you move yourself to make the lamp seem to
appear and disappear?Â  Spin! By spinning your body around in a circle,
you can make the lamp seem to 'rise' and 'set'.

As shown in Fig. 5.25, a spinning Earth represents the fixed Sun,
rotating Earth explanatory model for day and night.

-   What evidence supports this model?

None to which we have direct access in this course. So far, this is just
a theoretical idea that we have been acting out with the movements
described above.

An everyday way to help students visualize the Fixed Sun, Rotating Earth
model, however, is to take advantage of equipment frequently found in
classrooms: a globe of the Earth.

-   Tape a stick figure on the globe, at the place representing where
    you live
-   Turn out the lights, turn on a lamp without a shade, spin the globe
    and watch the stick figure spin in and out of the light shining on
    it from the lamp.

Note that this is another illustration of the proposed model of a
rotating Earth rather than evidence that supports its confirmation.

This is known as the *heliocentric* model. The prefix *helio-* refers to
the Sun and *centric* refers to something that is at the center,
something around which other things revolve.

Later in this course, you will develop a logical argument in favor of
the Fixed Sun, Rotating Earth model. Meanwhile, here is some information
about physical evidence for the Fixed Sun, Rotating Earth model that can
be obtained with resources outside this course:

-   To observe an effect of the rotation of the Earth, visit a Foucault
    pendulum as shown in Fig. 5.26. (See
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Foucault_pendulums> for
    suggestions of where one can see such a pendulum. There is one, for
    example, at the Portland Oregon Convention Center,
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oYvffE6iGY> ,
    [http://www.seattleastronomy.com/blog1/2011/10/the-worlds-biggest-foucault-pendulum/](http://www.seattleastronomy.com/blog1/2011/10/the-worlds-biggest-foucault-pendulum))
    Watch as a pendulum on a long cable swings back and forth. After a
    while the pendulum will appear to be swinging in a different
    direction as the floor has rotated underneath it as indicated by the
    fallen pegs in Fig. 5.26.

-   To watch a Foucault pendulum in action via the Internet (see:
    <https://www.geophysik.uni-muenchen.de/outreach/foucault-pendulum>)
    or simulated
    (<https://www.classzone.com/books/earth_science/terc/content/visualizations/es0403/es0403page01.cfm?chapter_no=visualization>.)

LÃ©on Foucault (1819-1868) demonstrated the Earth's rotation in this way
in Paris in 1851
(<https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200702/history.cfm>).

Another effect of the Earth's rotation involves weather. Storms in the
northern hemisphere swirl counterclockwise whereas those in the southern
hemisphere swirl clockwise.Â  Gustave Coriolis, (1792-1843), a French
mathematician and engineer, explained this effect.Â  For information
about the Coriolis effect, see:Â 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2mec3vgeaI> and
[https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/coriolis-effect/
Â Â ](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/coriolis-effect)

For a real-time demonstration of the Coriolis effect, download a free
version of the app *my radar*, open, scroll through "layers" until you
see "wind," click on wind, broaden the view until you can see the oceans
in both hemispheres and watch how the winds swirl. The red dots indicate
earthquakes.

-   How do the wind patterns shown in Fig. 5.27 indicate where the
    equator is?

-   Make sketches illustrating the two explanatory models for day and
    night.
-   Also complete entries in Table V.3. Then write a summary of what you
    have learned before reading an example of student work about
    explanatory modes for day and night. Also available is a brief
    introduction to historical interpretations of these phenomena.

: TABLE V.3 Developing Two Explanatory Models for Day and Night

Â 

#### *1. Example of student work about developing two explanatory models for day and night* {#chapter-045-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-two-explanatory-models-for-day-and-night.html#U5H420}

In representing the Fixed Earth, Revolving Sun exploratory model as
shown in Fig. 5.28, the student drew a stick figure to represent a
person on a fixed earth. An arm points to the east, where the Sun seems
to rise; next the arm points high in the sky, where the Sun seems to be
about noon; and then the arm points to the west, where the Sun seems to
set. Â To complete this representation, the arm finally swings down and
around back up to the rising position in the east to represent the Sun
continuing its journey below the horizon

In representing the Fixed Sun, Rotating Earth explanatory model, the
student wrote, *Sun represented by light on stool, moon represented as
basketball held in one place. I am earth and I rotate counterclockwise.
Left hand = rising, facing = high, right hand = setting; \*facing
south.*

:::

***Developing two explanatory models for day and night*** *. ...we
discussed two explanatory models for day and night. We demonstrated
these ideas by using our arms, a basketball, a light, and...our bodies
to represent the Sun, the Moon, and the...earth.*

***A Fixed Earth, Revolving Sun Model can explain day and night.** As we
have observed, the sun seems to rise in the east, move high across the
sky, and set in the west. During this motion we stay 'right here' on a
fixed earth. This sounds familiar because this model is what we
typically think: the sun rises and sets...In class we modeled this by
pointing one arm out with our hand representing the sun and then moving
that arm in a circle to represent the sun rising, high in the sky, and
setting.*

***A Fixed Sun, Rotating Earth Model also can explain day and night.**
In this model the Sun is thought of as "just there" and we on the earth
are moving. We modeled this in class by holding both arms straight out
to our side, with one pointing at the lamp, then rotating in place so
that the lamp (sun) seemed to rise, be high in the sky, and set while we
spun around. First one arm pointed to the lamp (rising) and then (we
were) facing the lamp (noon) and the other arm pointed to the lamp
(setting) and then (we were) facing away from the lamp (midnight) and
continuing to turn so the other arm was once again pointing at the lamp
(rising).*

#### *2. Interpreting two different models for the same phenomenon* {#chapter-045-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-two-explanatory-models-for-day-and-night.html#U5H421}

Having two different models that explain the same phenomenon frequently
occurs as one is exploring something of interest systematically.
Eventually arguments based on evidence may lead to confirming one
explanation as more likely than the other. However, both can be useful
in particular contexts.

When enjoying a beautiful sunset, for example, it is easy to "see" the
Sun sinking toward the horizon and hard to envision oneself instead as
whizzing by a fixed Sun. The Fixed Earth, Revolving Sun model seems
attractive in that one can daily observe the Sun apparently rising,
moving high across the sky, and setting instead of thinking of oneself
as spinning by the Sun while on the surface of a rotating Earth. The
Fixed Earth, Revolving Sun model also can be useful, as in our formal
process for predicting when and where to look for the Moon as summarized
in Table V.1.

The history of ideas about the Earth's rotation is connected to ideas
about the Earth's relation to the Sun. In the early 1500's, a Polish
astronomer, Nicholas Copernicus (1473-1543), wrote in Latin about his
assumptions that the Earth spins on its axis as it revolves around the
Sun, rather than the firmament (sun, moon, planets, and stars) revolving
around the Earth:

5.  *Whatever motion appears in the firmament arises not from any motion
    of the firmament, but from the earth's motion. The earth together
    with its circumjacent elements performs a complete rotation on its
    fixed poles in a daily motion, while the firmament and highest
    heaven abide unchanged. (translation)*

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
6.  *What appear to us as motions of the sun arise not from its motion
    but from the motion of the earth and our sphere, with which we
    revolve about the sun like any other planet. The earth has, then,
    more than one motion. (translation)*

*Nicolaus Copernicus* *,* *Commentariolus*

([http://ian.umces.edu/blog/2014/01/14/nicholas-copernicus-and-the-copernican-revolution/](http://ian.umces.edu/blog/2014/01/14/nicholas-copernicus-and-the-copernican-revolution)).

Â 

This perspective was so controversial, however, that Copernicus did not
publish his ideas until 1543. His book *On the Revolutions of the
Heavenly Sphere* appeared shortly before his death.

Almost a century later, in 1632, Galileo (1564-1642) published a book,
*Dialogue,* later titled *Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World
Systems,* in which he presented a discussion among three individuals
about the generally accepted geocentric Ptolemaic system and the
heliocentric Copernican system. In 1633, the Roman Catholic Church
banned Galileo's writings, including this book, and placed him under
house arrest until his death in 1642.

During the 350th anniversary of Galileo's death, in 1992, Pope John Paul
II addressed the Pontifical Academy of Sciences about "the Galileo
case.*"* He reported the findings of a committee that had concluded that
Galileo's preference for the Copernican perspective was correct. (SeeÂ 
<https://www.nytimes.com/1992/10/31/world/after-350-years-vatican-says-galileo-was-right-it-moves.html>
). In his speech to the Academy, Pope John Paul II said,

*12. Another lesson which we can draw is thatÂ the different branches of
knowledge call for different methods.Â Thanks to his intuition as a
brilliant physicist and by relying on different arguments, Galileo, who
practically invented the experimental method, understood why only the
Sun could function as the centre of the world, as it was then known,
that is to say as a planetary system. The error of the theologians of
the time, when they maintained the centrality of the Earth, was to think
that our understanding of the physical world's structure was, in some
way, imposed by the literal sense of the Sacred Scripture. Let us recall
the celebrated saying attributed to Baronius:Â "Spiritui Sancto mentem
fuisse nos docere quomodo ad coelum eatur non quomodo coelum
gradiatur."\*Â In fact the Bible does not concern itself with the details
of the physical world, the understanding of which is the competence of
human experience and reasoning. There exist two realms of knowledge, one
which has its source in Revelation and one which reason can discover by
its own power. To the latter belong especially the experimental sciences
and philosophy. The distinction between the two realms of knowledge
ought not to be understood as opposition. The two realms are not
altogether foreign to each other; they have points of contact. The
methodologies proper to each make it possible to bring out different
aspects of reality.*

*Pope John Paul II, 1992*

Pope John Paul II, Address to the Plenary Session on 'The Emergence of
Complexity in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry and Biology' 31 October
1992, (Vatican City: the Pontifical Academy of Sciences).
<http://www.accademiascienze.va/content/accademia/en/magisterium/johnpaulii/31october1992.html>

\*Galileo also had quoted this saying in a letter to the Grand Duchess
Christina of Tuscany in 1615: [*I would say here something that was
heard from an ecclesiastic of the most eminent degree: "That the
intention of the Holy Ghost is to teach us how* *one goes to heaven, not
how heaven goes*." (lines 373-376, bottom of page
5)Â <https://hti.osu.edu/sites/hti.osu.edu/files/galileo_galilei.pdf>]{style="font-size: 9pt"}

In this address, Pope John Paul II drew a clear distinction between the
realm of religious faith and the realm of the experimental sciences
while offering respect for both. The methodology of science involves
making claims based on evidence and presenting arguments that explain
the rationale for why the evidence supports the claim.

As noted in II.B.4, *Joseph's Moon*, even very young children are aware
of the Moon and able to communicate what they are observing. That the
Moon often is visible during the day is a surprise to many adults. After
starting to notice the Moon during the day, many also become puzzled
that the Moon sometimes seems to chase the Sun across the sky but
sometimes the Sun seems to chase the Moon. Also intriguing after more
systematic observation is the paradox that the Moon seems to move like
the Sun, from east to west over several hours, but in the opposite
direction, from west to east, over several days.

These are examples of the increasing complexity typical of scientific
endeavors, in which more detailed observations prompt deeper pondering
and questioning. This section explains these observations in the context
of developing an explanatory model for the Moon's changing phases. We
then consider how the Moon appears to us here on Earth compared to how
the Moon would appear if we could look down upon the Moon, Earth, and
Sun from above the solar system. The section also discusses the causes
of solar and lunar eclipses and concludes with exploring Internet
resources about the Moon to share with a friend or family member.

##### ***Question 5.23 Why does the Moon seem to have different shapes at different times?*** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H523 style="text-align: center"}

This section begins with a review of relevant central ideas, next
presents a report on a child's insights about the Sun and the Moon, and
then proceeds with developing an explanation for the Moon's changing
phases as seen from here on Earth.

### **A. Reviewing Â central ideas about the relationship between the Sun and the Moon** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H311}

What central ideas developed so far describe the relationship between
the Sun and the Moon?

-   The Sun is always on the same side as the lit side of the Moon.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The shape of the lit portion of the Moon that we see from Earth
    changes in a regular pattern:\
    Where we live in the northern hemisphere, the shape of the lit
    portion of the Moon grows from a crescent lit on the right (waxing
    crescent), to half lit on the right (first quarter), to more than
    half lit on the right (waxing gibbous), to fully lit; then decreases
    to more than half lit on the left (waning gibbous), half lit on the
    left (third quarter), to a crescent lit on the left (waning
    crescent), to no moon visible (new moon). In the southern
    hemisphere, the shape of the lit portion of the Moon changes in a
    similar pattern but from lit on the left (waxing phases) to lit on
    the right (waning phases).

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   The angle formed by pointing one arm at the Moon and one arm at the
    Sun changes in a regular pattern related to the changing shape of
    the lit portion of the Moon that we see:\
    As the lit side of the Moon seems to get bigger, the angle gets
    bigger until the Moon is fully lit and the angle is a straight
    angle; as the lit side of the Moon seems to get smaller until not
    visible, the angle gets smaller until the angle is zero.

### **B. Building upon a child's insights about the phases of the Moon** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H312}

Andy diSessa (1986) described an experience that he had one day as a
child. He was tossing a ball up and catching it when he happened to
notice both the moon and the ball as he looked up in the sky. When he
tossed the ball straight up so that it was high enough to seem to be
near the moon, he suddenly realized, *Â "I was seeing the phase of my
little tennis ball/moon and that it was the same as the phase of the
real moon!"* If feasible, we try to schedule modeling the phases of the
moon on a sunny day when students can replicate this experience by
seeing the lighted side of a ball next to the moon they are seeing in
the sky. (We provide balls on sticks that the students hold in their
hands rather than tossing their balls.)

*Instructional Science, **14***, 207-227.Â  (p. 213).

### **C. Developing an explanatory model for the phases of the Moon** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H313}

As a first step in explaining the changing phases of the Moon, consider
the following:

-   What is the source of the light that shines on the Earth from the
    Moon?
-   What phase is the Moon in today?
-   What do you expect to see in the next few days?

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;padding: 5px"}
Equipment: To model the phases of the Moon, go outside on a sunny day or
use a lamp without a shade to represent the Sun in a dark room; use a
small ball (golf ball, ping pong ball, Styrofoam ball) on a stick to
represent the Moon, and your head to represent the Earth.
:::

-   If outside, DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN!\
    If inside, stand well away from a lamp without a shade in a dark
    room.
-   How can you hold up your ball so that the lit portion of the ball
    looks like the current lit portion of the Moon in the sky?
-   How can you move your ball to see on the ball here on Earth all of
    the phases of the Moon that you have been observing in the sky?
    -   [For example, hold the ball up so that the Sun (or the lamp) is
        shining on the ball to light the ball as a **waxing crescent**
        ball**.\

Â 

-   How have you moved the ball to replicate seeing on the ball the same
    pattern of changing phases here on Earth that you have observed on
    the Moon in the sky?
-   What can you infer is the cause of the changing phases of the Moon?
-   Make a series of sketches that illustrate how you used the Sun (or a
    lamp without a shade as a model of the Sun), a ball on a stick, and
    yourself to model the phases of the Moon.

This explanatory model for the phases of the Moon can be summarized as:

**The phases of the Moon are caused by the Moon revolving around the
Earth.**

-   Take the perspective of looking down on this Sun/Earth/Moon system
    from above:
    -   Model this in a dark room lit by a lamp with no shade.
    -   Hold one hand out in front of your body, thumb up, so you are
        looking down on the thumb from above. Let the thumb represent
        the Earth.
    -   Hold a ball in the other hand to represent the Moon. Move the
        ball around your thumb while looking down on both.
    -   For each phase, look at the side of the ball that is facing
        toward the lamp. How is it lit?
    -   For each phase, look at the side of the ball that is facing away
        from the lamp. How is it lit?
-   What does this imply about the shaded side of a phase of the Moon as
    seen from Earth?

learned before reading an example of student work about developing an

#### *1. Examples of student work developing an explanatory model of the phases of the Moon* {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H422}

***The Sun is the source of light from the Moon on the Earth.***
*Through our knowledge that the Moon does not appear to be fully lit,
based on our observations, we can infer that this light is not coming
from the Moon but from another source.*

*We can also surmise that from these observations we see the lit portion
of the Moon to be always on the same side as the Sun, so the Moon's
light is coming from the Sun.*

*We infer that light rays from the Sun are bouncing off the Moon in all
directions from the surface of the Moon that is facing the Sun; some of
these light rays travel in the direction of Earth when some of the lit
part of the Moon's surface is facing Earth.*

***The phases of the Moon are caused by the Moon revolving
counter-clockwise around the Earth about once a month as seen from our
location.*** *Going to the roof of a building you can create a
replication of what happens with the Earth, Sun and Moon. The Sun was
the Sun and I was me standing on Earth and I used a physical model of
the Moon (a ball) to represent the Moon.Â *

*By holding the ball directly in front of the sun, in front of my face,
this represented new moon. (The ball blocked the light of the Sun from
my eyes.)*

*Â By moving the ball to the left at an acute angle from the sun we were
able to see the depiction of the waxing crescent moon on the ball.*

*We did this at each stage as we simulated a revolution of the ball
around the "earth" to see all the phases of the moon until the ball was
in front of us and the sun, creating a new moon once again.*

*This could also be done in a darkened room with a light from a lamp
representing the Sun, but if you are doing this method you have to
remember to back up across the room to get the right effect on the
ball.Â *

*From these activities here on Earth we can infer that we see the
changing phases of the Moon in the sky because **the Moon is REVOLVING
around the Earth.***

Physics student, Fall 2014

Another student included a set of diagrams that showed the Sun as well
as a student holding a ball on a stick in such a way as to show the lit
portion on the ball for each phase of the ball. The angles formed by
pointing toward the Sun (in the sky or toward a lamp in a dark room) and
holding out the ball were the same as observed in the sky for the phases
when pointing one arm at the Sun and the other arm at the Moon.

As shown in Fig. 5.29, the student was able to create on the ball the
phases seen as waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, and full

Physics student, Fall 2016

Figures 5.29 and 5.30 suggest why this process has been dubbed *Moon
Dance 2.*

To model the phases of the Moon as seen from above the solar system, the
students held out their thumbs and looked down as they moved their balls
around their thumbs. This showed clearly that in all positions the side
of the ball facing toward the lamp was always fully lit and that the
side of the ball facing away from the lamp was always dark. A student
reflected upon the experience of looking down on the ball as it revolved
around the thumb as follows:

***The side of the Moon facing the Sun is always fully lit.*** *In class
students were given a ball on a stick. This ball was small,
approximately the size of a ping pong ball. Students were asked to
picture their thumb as the earth, and to revolve the "moon" around our
"earth". While doing this a lamp was placed on one side of the room and
turned on to represent the sun. As students revolved their moon around
their earth they were able to see that in fact there is always half of
the moon being lit, the portion that is pointing towards the sun.
However, due to the position of the moon in reference to the earth we
cannot always see this full lit portion.*

***The dark side of the moon is the shadow of the Moon on itself***
***.*** *Students learned in one of our early lessons that there are two
types of shadows, there is a shadow cast by an object blocking light
from traveling on its intended path, and there is a shadow formed on the
back of the object that is blocking the light. The dark side of the moon
is actually the shadow formed on the back of the object blocking the
light, the moon.*

Physics student, Fall 2015

When asked why the moon seems to have different shapes at different
times, many people attribute the shaded side of a phase of the Moon to
the shadow of the Earth. This may be because they associate shadows with
situations in which light from a source is blocked by a barrier. In this
case, however, the barrier is the Moon itself. This is similar to the
shadow on the back side of a barrier placed between a lamp and a screen,
as in Question 1.6 and Fig. 1.8 in Unit 1.

#### *1. Example of student work resolving the paradox about the apparent movements of the Moon* {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H423}

*In figure (5.31) below, we were drawing a model for our observations of
the sky over several hours. When we watch the sun and moon over several
hours, the sun seems to rise in the east, move across the sky in an arc
shape, and then set in the west. Â The moon seems to do the same by
rising in the east, transitioning across the sky in an arc and setting
in the west. This model makes it appear as if, for day and night, the
planet Earth is stationary and the sun and moon are revolving around the
earth each 24 hours. This model is easy for one to wrap the brain
around, as it is what we initially observe, and it is in the language we
learned to describe what we see, the sun rises, the sun sets. This model
is challenged, however, by the second model, figure (5.32).*

*In figure (5.32), we were drawing a model for if one was to watch the
sky over several days, observing at the same time each day. In this
model, the moon seemed to move from west to east, contrary to the first
model. If someone were to look at the moon over many days at 6 pm, where
we live they would see a waxing crescent moon low in the southwestern
sky, then a first quarter moon high in the southern sky, followed by a
waxing gibbous moon midway up in the southeastern sky, and finally a
full moon rising in the east. This model makes it seem as if the moon is
revolving around the earth from west to east over about two weeks.*

:::

*These two models pose a paradoxical situation where the moon both seems
to be moving across the sky from east to west, and west to east.Â  How
can this be? Well it is important to understand that, although we can
more easily accept the stationary Earth model in figure (5.31), that
model does not make it the best. In order to explain this paradox, we
need to be able to accept (the following).*

*The sun is still and it is the earth that is moving by rotating on its
axis. If we remain in the same location on the earth as it first rotates
by the sun, the sun seems to rise in the east. As (our location on) the
earth rotates directly by the sun, the sun seems to be moving high
across the sky, around noon. Finally, as (our location on) the earth
spins all the way past the sun, the sun seems to set, and the daylight
ends. When our location on Earth rotates away from the sun, it becomes
night.*

*The same happens with the moon. The earth's first rotation by the moon
shows the moon appearing to rise. As (our location on) the earth spins
directly by the moon, the moon seems to be transitioning across the sky
in an arc. As (our location on) the earth finally spins all the way past
the moon, the moon seems to be setting. This model is a way to defend
the apparent daily east to west motion of both the sun and moon due to
the earth's daily rotation on its axis.*

*In class, we used ping pong balls on a stick to represent the moon and
a lamp to represent the sun...With the ball on the stick physical model
representing the moon we replicated the changing phases of the moon. Â By
moving the ball in an orbit around our heads, we could see the waxing
crescent ball, first quarter ball, waxing gibbous ball, full ball,
waning gibbous ball, third quarter ball, waning crescent ball, and new
ball.*

*From these models, we can infer that the moon is moving from west to
east over about two weeks, caused by the moon revolving around the
earth. We also could see that the fixed sun, rotating earth model was
the truer model. The apparent east to west movement during the day is
only due to the earth spinning on its axis. That is how we have
explained this paradoxical situation.*

Physics student, Fall 2016

Note the difference in meaning between the two words describing the
motions involved here:

**REVOLVE**: one object moves around another; the Moon REVOLVES around
Earth roughly once a month (29.5 days)

**ROTATE:**Â  spinning on an axis; the Earth ROTATES once daily

#### *2. Acting out the explanation of this paradox* {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H424}

Playing the roles of an observer on Earth, of the Moon, and of the Sun
in the paradox can help build understandings of what the paradox is and
how it can be explained:

Â 

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;padding: 5px"}
Equipment: Small groups of three students work together to act out this
paradox: use a flashlight to represent the Sun and a ball to represent
the Moon; one person plays the role of an observer on Earth, another
person Â holds the ball and plays the role of the Moon, the third person
holds the flashlight and plays the role of the Sun.

-   Where should the "Moon" person stand with respect to the "Sun"
    person and the "Earth" person in order to model the current phase of
    the Moon?

```{=html}

```
-   For a first quarter Moon, for example, the "Moon" person should
    stand so that the "Earth" person can form a right angle by pointing
    arms at the "Sun" person holding the flashlight and at the "Moon"
    person holding the ball. As shown in Fig. 5.3, this could model a
    rising first quarter Moon .

-   Summarize concisely what the paradox is and how it can be explained.

Students can conduct this activity without a ball if the "Moon" person's
face is regarded as representing the Moon. Another possibility is to
have students stand as a group, far enough apart to model rotating
Earths, while one student revolves around the group while holding a ball
representing the Moon revolving around the Earth and while a lamp simply
remains in place.

This complex process of acting out the explanation of the Moon
apparently moving east to west over several hours, due to the daily
rotation of the Earth, and actually moving west to east over several
days, due to the revolution of the Moon around the Earth, has been
dubbed *Moon Dance 3.*

### **E. Considering other aspects of the Moon's motion** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H315}

Several questions typically arise after students have experience
observing the moon and explaining what they have seen. These include
whether the moon rotates while it revolves and what the Moon's phases
look like from other places.

##### ***Question 5.25 Does the Moon rotate while it revolves around the Earth?*** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H525}

-   Observe the features visible on the Moon that you see during each
    phase. (see:
    <https://www.space.com/10610-moon-craters-skywatching-tips.html> )
-   Do the locations of particular craters seem to change? Is the crater
    named for Copernicus, for example, always in the same place on the
    Moon as seen from your location (midway somewhat to the left of the
    center as seen from our location)?
-   Stand in pairs. One of you model the rotating Earth while the other
    models the revolving Moon as in Question 5.24. The person modeling
    the revolving Moon should keep facing the Earth during a complete
    revolution.
-   Start in the new moon position. If the person modeling the revolving
    Moon always faces the person modeling the Earth, is the "Moon"

A first-grade teacher, Akiko Kurose, engaged her students in watching
the Moon in Seattle. Stella (a pseudonym) continued watching the Moon
while visiting Australia with her parents for about a month. The city of
Melbourne in Australia is in the southern hemisphere, near the bottom of
a typical globe of the Earth as shown in Fig. 5.35. The city of Seattle
in the United States is in the northern hemisphere near the top of a
typical globe of the Earth. A line around the middle of the globe
represents the *equator*.

When Stella returned to Seattle, she and her classmates compared their
observations of the waxing crescent Moon as shown in Figs. 5.36 and
5.37.

FIG. 5.37 Observations of the waxing crescent moon in Seattle.

:::

The teacher was participating in a study in which she routinely
audiotaped conversations about science in her class. She reported the
following:

*...For discussion, we used a globe and a map on the floor. Australia is
in the southern and Seattle in the northern hemisphere. Some of the
children lay on the floor and realized that if they are upside down
something lit on the right looks as if it is lit on the left:*

*Teacher:Â  Stella, do you want to tell us about your observations in
Australia?*

*Stella: Â Â Â  The waxing crescent moon was facing the other way.*

*Teacher:Â  The waxing crescent moon was facing the other way?*

*Why do you think it was facing the other way?*

*Stella: Â Â Â  It was on the other side of the world.*

*The children and I found Australia and Seattle on a globe. Then Stella
drew her observation on the board, a crescent moon curved on the left.*

*Student: It's like the waning crescent.*

*Student: I thought it was like this! (The child turned upside down.)*

*Teacher:Â  That's right. When he lies down on the ground he sees it the
opposite way.*

*Then we discussed how the waxing crescent moon would look in Canada.*

*Student: Right side up.*

*Teacher: What do you mean right side up?*

*Student: The way we see it.*

*Teacher: Do you mean the way we see it in Seattle?*

*Student: Uh, huh.*

*Teacher: In Australia, do you think they would think they're upside
down?*

*Student: No. Maybe. Stella thought so.*

*Teacher: For them, they would think that they're right side up,
wouldn't they?*

*It's just that they see it from a different perspective.*

*We also discussed how the moon would look in Florida and other places.*

*Student: My dad's been to Brazil.*

*Teacher: How do you think you would see the moon there?*

*Remember where the equator is. Make a hypothesis.*

*Student: The way Stella saw it in Australia.*

*Teacher: The way that Stella saw it in Australia....*

*So it depends upon where you are on earth.*

*Student: How does it look if you're on the equator?*

This was a new and unexpected question, a fascinating one that none of
us had thought about before. The teacher reflected upon this experience:

*The children's experiences in our daily moon gazings over a period of
several months also nurture their abstract thinking and questioning
skills...These experiences engender thoughts about the moon from
different places, granting the students the gift of a global
perspective. Engagement in this type of abstract thinking and
questioning has become part of our class culture, in which virtually all
of the children participate.*

These children were very familiar with the Moon from on-going
observations together on the playground when the moon was visible during
the day and from observations with their families when the moon was
visible in the afternoons and evenings or mornings before school. They
also were familiar with global thinking from celebrating the multiple
countries represented by students in the class, the daily opening
activity in which they sang a song in several languages, the world map
painted on the floor on which they could choose to sit on different
countries, and the globe, which was a familiar reference tool in their
explorations of literature and art.

### **F. Developing representations of the Sun/Earth/Moon system as seen from space** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H316}

This course has emphasized the exploration of physical phenomena,
development of central ideas based on evidence, and the use of these
central ideas to develop explanatory models for intriguing phenomena.
Through extensive observations and on-going discussions of the Moon and
its relation to the Sun, students have produced detailed insights into
when and where to look for each phase of the Moon, explained these
changing phases, and resolved a complex paradox that emerged from
detailed observations. All of this has been based upon the perspective
of an observer here on Earth. This section turns toward developing a
wider view.

Moving one's perspective from what one is seeing oneself to what one
would see if one were somewhere else is a complex process. This section
provides a report of a child's spontaneous wonderings involving various
perspectives and guides students in exploring how the Sun, Earth, and
Moon are arranged in space.

#### *1.*Â Building upon a*Â child's spontaneous wonderings* {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H425}

Andy diSessa (1986) continued his story by reflecting upon multiple
perspectives that he generated during his experience as a child in
tossing a ball and seeing the same phases on both the ball and the moon.
He remembered being impressed that even though the moon seemed to be far
away, it was "*on the scale set by the distance to the sun, just a
next-door neighbor distance*" to him and his ball. This realization led
him to imagine himself "*as a viewer far enough away to see the moon and
ball as right next to one another in relation to the sun."Â *Then he
began wondering about the Earth and concluded *Â "It too must have the
same illumination."* The next section takes up this issue of multiple
perspectives, of exploring more explicitly about how things look from
space.

have seen in the sky.
:::

In order to make connections between how each of the Moon's phases look
on Earth and how they each look from space, we need to know how the Sun,
Earth, and Moon are arranged in space. An easy phase to think about is a
quarter Moon as shown in Fig. 5.38.

-   What is the angle formed by pointing your arms at the Sun and a
    quarter moon?
-   When we consider the Sun and a full Moon, how do their sizes
    compare? (DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SUN!
-   How might the Sun, Earth, and Moon be arranged in space?

When solar eclipses occur, the Sun and full Moon appear to be about the
same size. This suggests they might be roughly the same distance away
from Earth as shown here:

Â  M

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  S Â  Â  Â  Â E

Or the Sun might be close to Earth and the Moon far away as shown here:

Â  Â M

Â 

</div>

Â 

<div>

Â  SÂ Â Â  E

Or the Sun may be far from Earth and the Moon close by as shown here:

Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â

FIG. 5.38 Â Three possible arrangements for the Sun, Earth, and Moon in
space.

-   How can you decide which of these arrangements of the Sun, Earth,
    and Moon is the case?
-   Consider modeling here on Earth what you see in the sky during a
    quarter Moon:

-   If the Sun is very far away and the Moon is close by but they look
    about the same size in the sky, what are their relative sizes?

#### *3. Example of student work discussing the arrangement and relative sizes of the Sun, and Moon.* {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H427}

***The moon is close to the earth and the sun is far away.*** *Â To model
evidence of this statement we took a basketball in our right hand and
held it out to the right side and took our left arm and held it out in
front of us, creating a 90 degree angle. We started with a darkened room
and a lamp directly in front of us, representing the sun, the basketball
representing the moon and ourselves representing the Earth. We started
about an arm's length from the "sun" and knew from previous observation
that if the sun and moon are 90 degrees apart that the "moon" should be
half lit representing a quarter moon. However, the ball looked more than
half lit when held equidistant from the lamp with arms at 90 degrees.Â 
So in order to accomplish this visual we had to walk backwards until
only half of the "moon" was lit, which ended up being about halfway
across the room. Based on the visual we had just given ourselves with
this representation, we could then infer that the sun is far away from
the moon and the earth is closer to the moon.*

***The moon is small and the sun is very large.*** *When looking at the
sun and moon in the sky it is very hard to tell which is bigger and
which is smaller, or if they might be the same size. Based on the
previous example, we inferred that the sun was far away from the earth
and moon, so we recreated this same scenario in the classroom to
demonstrate why we see what we see in the sky. Everyone was to look up
at the clock in the classroom and hold their thumb up so it looked like
they were visually next to each other. Then we were told to back up
until our thumb and the clock appeared to be the same size, so everyone
backed up and was almost all the way on the other side of the room
before their thumb appeared to be the same size as the clock. We saw how
far we were from it and then were told to walk up close to the clock and
see how large the clock was as we got closer. It seemed huge at a short
distance! With this simulation we have some information that allows us
to infer why the sun may seem the same size, because it is so far away,
but in reality is very large compared to the moon and earth.*

    -   For each phase, add arms with one pointing at the Sun and the
        other pointing at the appropriate angle for the Moon for each
        phase.
    -   Sketch the Moon with about the same diameter of the circle
        representing the Sun and with the appropriate shape for each
        phase.
-   Inferred view from above the solar system:
    -   Sketch a large curve at the top of the box to represent part of
        a large Sun.
    -   Sketch a small circle near the bottom of the box to represent

    -   For each phase, sketch a smaller circle (about Â¼ size of Earth)
        to represent the Moon; place this smaller circle near the circle
        representing the Earth, so that this Moon forms the appropriate
        angle with respect to the Earth and Sun for that phase.

#### *5. Nuances about viewing the phases of the Moon from above the solar system* {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H429}

The right columns of Figs. 5.42 and 5.43 show inferred views from above
the solar system as the Moon revolves around the Earth. For the Moon,
the side facing toward the Sun is always fully it. This is shown as
half-lit in Figs. 5.42 and 5.43 because this is a view from above a
fully lit sphere facing the Sun. The same would be the case for the
Earth as well. The circle representing the Earth in Figs. 5.42 and 5.43
also should be shown as fully lit sphere facing the Sun (which looks
half lit from above).

In the right columns of Figs. 5.42 and 5.43, the side of the Moon facing
away from the Sun is not lit. This represents that the shaded side of a
phase of the Moon is caused by the Moon's shadow on itself. It is not
the shadow of the Earth. This is similar to the shadow on the back side
of a barrier placed between a lamp and a screen, as in Question 1.6 and
Fig. 1.8 in Unit 1. The same would be the case for the Earth as well.
The circle representing the Earth in the right columns of Figs. 5.42 and
5.43 also should be dark for the side facing away from the Sun.

In the right columns of Figs. 5.42 and 5.43, the relative sizes of the
circles representing the Earth and Moon should show the Moon about Â¼ the
size of the Earth. This is an assertion by the instructor rather than a
comparison resulting from an observation. The placement of the Moon
should be a consistent distance close to the Earth and both Earth and
Moon should be far from the Sun. The student has positioned the Moon
correctly for the various phases and has been consistent in showing the
Moon's lit face toward the Sun and the dark side away from the Sun.

In the left columns of Figs. 5.42 and 5.43, the student has shown the
size of the Sun and the Moon as roughly equal, as they appear from
Earth. The shapes of the phases and angles formed by pointing at the Sun
and Moon are basically correct. The phases that are not visible at noon
are shown at the correct angle below the horizon.

Fig. 5.44 shows another way to illustrate what the phases of the moon
would look like from above the solar system as well as on Earth.

Sunlight is shown as coming from so far away that the rays traveling
toward the Earth and Moon are parallel. The positions of the Moon in its
revolution around the Earth are numbered, starting with new Moon. The
views of the phases as seen from the northern hemisphere on Earth are
shown separately in the adjacent table. This is helpful because the
first quarter moon at position \#3 is shown appropriately lit on the
same side as the incoming sunlight, on the left as seen from above the
solar system. This phase (\#3) also is shown appropriately lit on the
right in the table showing the phases as seen from the northern
hemisphere on Earth.

In contrast, many diagrams of the Moon's phases combine the views from
Earth and from above the solar system into one diagram as in Fig. 5.45.
In such diagrams, the moons representing the Moon in orbit are all lit
the same way, facing the Sun. The moons representing waning phases as
seen from Earth, however, are lit facing away from the Sun. Such
combined diagrams can be very confusing for students who are just
learning that the Sun is always on the same side as the lit side of the
Moon.

The *dark sideof the Moon* is the half of the moon that is *not facing
the Sun* and is in the Moon's own shadow; as the Moon revolves around
the Earth, the dark side is always dark.

The *front side of the Moon* is the half of the moon that *is facing the
Sun* and is always lit; as the Moon revolves around the Earth, the front
side is always lit.

The *far sideof the Moon*Â is the half of the moon that*Â is facing away
from the Earth* and is represented by the green stripes.

The *near side of the Moon*Â is the half of the moon that *isÂ facing the
Earth*, which is what we "see" from Earth:

-   In the new moon position (\#1), for example, the near side of the
    Moon is the same as the dark side of the Moon and is completely
    dark, which is why we cannot see the new moon in the sky even when
    the sky is clear. It looks like the Moon should be casting a shadow
    on the Earth, which it does during a solar eclipse. Usually,
    however, the Moon is a little above or below the direct line of
    sight and the Moon's shadow misses the Earth.
-   In the waxing crescent phase (\#2), the near side of the Moon is
    partially lit and what we see from Earth is that partially lit side,
    which looks like a crescent.
-   In the 1st quarter phase (\#3), the near side of the Moon is half
    lit and that's what we see from Earth.
-   In the waxing gibbous phase (\#4), the near side of the Moon is
    mostly lit, on the right side as seen from the northern hemisphere,
    on the left side as seen from the southern hemisphere.
-   In the full phase (\#5), the near side of the Moon is the same as
    the front side of the Moon and is fully lit as seen everywhere from
    Earth. The Earth looks like it is in the way and should be casting a
    shadow on the Moon, which it does during a lunar eclipse. Usually,
    however, the Moon is a little above or below the Earth's shadow and
    not eclipsed.
-   The waning phases are similar, with the near side facing the Earth
    now showing less and less of the lit side facing the Sun.

Envisioning what one would see from the perspective of standing on the
Earth can be confusing when looking at such diagrams. If you envision
yourself standing on the top half of the blue Earth (in the northern
hemisphere) and looking outward from the Earth toward position \#3 in
the circle (which is lit on the left), for example, you would see the
Moon half lit on the right as shown for phase \#3 in the row below. If
you envision yourself standing on the bottom half of the blue earth (in
the southern hemisphere) and looking toward position \#3, you would see
the Moon half lit on the left as shown in the the circle.

Such diagrams reflect choices made by the artists who drew them. The
artists drawing Figures 5.44 and 5.46, for example, drew rays from the
Sun coming from the left whereas the artist for Figure 5.45 drew rays
coming from the right. Figure 5.46 shows an Earth and moons of the same
size whereas both Fig. 5.44 and Fig. 5.45 show moons about half the size
of the Earth. The appropriate proportion would be a moon about 1/4 the
diameter of an Earth. In addition, the artists drawing Figures 5.44 and
5.46 drew from the perspective of looking down from above the solar
system with the Moon revolving around the Earth in a circular orbit
whereas the artist drawing Figure 5.45 drew from the perspective of
looking from the side so that the Moon's almost circular orbit looks
like an elongated ellipse. You can see this effect of a circular object
looking like an elongated eclipse by looking down on a circular lid and
then moving the lid up until you are looking directly at it from the
side.

##### ***Question 5.30 Does the Moon revolve around the Earth in the clockwise or counter-clockwise direction?*** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H530}

-   Compare the representations of the Moon's revolution around the
    Earth in Figs. 5.29, 5.30, 5.32, 5.42 -- 5.46. Are they consistent?
    If so, do they represent the Moon as revolving clockwise or
    counter-clockwise around the Earth?
-   Suppose you are teaching students in Australia and choose to develop
    an explanation for the changing phases of the moon as discussed in
    section V.A.3 above. The students would need to move a ball around
    their heads so that the waxing phases look lit on the left and the
    waning phases look lit on the right. How should they move their
    balls? Clockwise or counter-clockwise?

        *penumbra* parts of the Earth's shadow. The *umbra* is the dark
        central shadow formed by the Earth blocking light from all areas

        either side of the umbra by the Earth blocking light from only
        one side of the Sun.

The reason that eclipses do not happen every month is that the Moon's
orbit is tilted about 5Â° as shown in Fig. 5.47.

***Eclipses occur when the Moon is precisely in line with the Earth and
the Sun.*** *Below (Figs. 5.48 and 5.49) I have inserted both a sketch
of a lunar eclipse and a solar eclipse. We recently had a lunar eclipse
back in September. In my sketch you can see that this is when the Sun,
Moon and Earth are directly in front of each other, basically in a
straight line. The Earth is between the Moon and the Sun; this is the
Earth blocking the light rays from the Sun getting to the Moon. This is
what created what people say was the "Blood Moon". The moon was dark,
but still had a slight outline of its shape. It was crazy to be able to
see that, it was awesome!*

*I was lucky enough to be able to see that in my lifetime and will
actually get to see a solar eclipse as well. There is a prediction that
this is going to be visible from Corvallis in August of 2017. A solar
eclipse is when the Moon is between the Sun and the Earth. There is
going to be a portion of the Earth that is going to see this at this
time. This is because the Moon is blocking the Sun in that specific
spot. This is crazy to think about because the last one happened back in
1991 when I was not even born yet.Â Â Â Â *

### **H.Â Exploring Internet resources about the Moon with a friend or family member** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H318}

##### ***Question 5.32 What Internet resources are available for teaching and learning*** ***about the Moon?*** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H532}

-   Put "phases of the moon" in your computer browser. View at least
    four websites that present a diagram and explanation about the
    phases of the moon. Select the diagram and explanation you like the
    best.Â  Why do you like this one best?
-   Invite a friend or family member to explore this website with you.
    If possible, invite someone of the age you want to teach. Then write
    a reflection upon your conversation:
    -   What does your friend/family member already know about the
        phases of the moon?
    -   Describe what your learner asked, said, did and found.
    -   What aspects of the website seemed to help this learner learn
        about the phases of the moon?
    -   What aspects of the website, if any, seemed to hinder learning?
    -   What have you learned about science learning and teaching from
        this experience?

#### *1. Example of student work about engaging a friend or family member* *in learning about the phases of the Moon* {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H431}

*For this assignment, I asked my family friend who is a 6th grade
student about the moon. When I asked her what she already knew about the
moon, she said things like "there are different shapes of the moon" and
"I see it at night." We looked at the
websiteÂ <https://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/aboutmoonphases.html> . I
liked this site because it not only had a picture of all the moon phases
which she seemed to somewhat know about, but also summaries for each
phase as well as some pictures that show where the moon, sun and earth
are at a certain phase.Â *

*G asked me why the moon spins in a circle around the earth. This was a
hard question for me to answer because I can't explain why it
revolvesÂ in a circle, I can just explain what is happening as it
revolves. I find that often times, my learners are asking me questions
that I have trouble answering.*

*An aspect of the website that seemed to really help us learn was the
variety of pictures that included the moon, sun and earth for different
phases, This helped me to show and explain that at different phases the
moon is in different places. However, there was lots of writing on the
website. While this was helpful for me, this seemed to hinder G's
learning, as she didn't have a desire to read it and it made the website
appear more difficult/boring.*

*In regards to science learning and teaching. I have learned through
this that there are going to be times where my students stump me. I am
not always going to know all the answers, but that is okay, and it is
part of science.Â *

This is another example of the nature of science, that as one learns
more and shares that knowledge with others, new questions often arise.
Question 5.48 addresses the question that emerged during this
conversation, what keeps the Moon revolving around the Earth in its
orbit?

### **I. Pausing to review before taking the next step** {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H319}

Before undertaking the next step in an extended exploration, it can be
helpful to review the understandings developed so far.

#### *2. Reviewing an explanatory model for the phases of the Moon* {#chapter-046-using-powerful-ideas-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-phases-of-the-moon.html#U5H433}

-   Where is the Sun with respect to the phase of the Moon when both are
    visible in the sky?
-   What are the phases of the moon observed?
-   How are these phases related to the angle formed by pointing one arm
    at the Sun and the other arm at the Moon?

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;padding: 5px"}
Equipment: Use a lamp without a shade, a ball on a stick, and your head
to replicate here on Earth the phases of the Moon observed in the sky.Â 
(See V, C,Â Question 5.23 )
:::

-   What is the logic by which one can infer that the phases of the Moon
    are caused by the revolution of the Moon around the Earth?
-   What causes lunar and solar eclipses?

Daily observations indicate that the Sun seems to rise in the east, move
in an arc across the sky and set in the west. The Moon seems to move in
the same way, rising in the east, moving in an arc across the sky, and
setting in the west. These observations suggest that the Sun and the
Moon revolve daily around the Earth. An alternative model, hard to
envision, is that the Earth is rotating on its axis daily, that we,
living on the surface of the Earth, are spinning on by the Sun and Moon
rather than that the Sun and Moon are revolving around us on a fixed
Earth.

On-going observations of the Moon indicate that the lit shape of the
Moon changes in a regular way, increasing from crescent to half lit to
more than half lit to full and then decreasing from more than half lit
to half lit to crescent to not being visible even when the sky is clear.
The Moon sometimes is visible during the day as well as at night.
Sometimes the Moon is lit on the right and sometimes on the left but
when both the Sun and the Moon are visible in the sky, the Sun is always
on the same side of the Moon that is lit.

The angle formed by pointing one arm at the Sun and one arm at the Moon
changes, from acute to right, to obtuse, to straight as the lit portion
of the Moon increases on the right at our location and back from
straight to obtuse to right to acute as the lit portion of the Moon
decreases on the left at our location. Patterns identified in systematic
observations of the relation between the lit portion of the Moon (its
phase) and this angle are useful in predicting when each phase of the
Moon will be rising, transiting, and setting. Such systematic
observations lead to paradoxes, however, such as that sometimes the Moon
seems to chase the Sun across the sky but sometimes the Sun seems to
chase the Moon. Also the Moon seems to move from east to west, like the
Sun, over several hours but in the opposite direction from west to east
over several days.

If both the Sun and the Moon are visible in the sky and one holds up a
ball near the Moon, one can see the Sun shining on the ball in the same
way that the Sun is shining on the Moon. It is important NOT to look
directly at the Sun in order to avoid damaging one's eyes! The shape of
the lit portion of the ball matches the shape of the lit portion of the
Moon. The shape of the dark part of the ball matches the shape of the
missing portion of the circular shape of a full Moon. The shadow forming
the dark part of the ball is the ball's own shadow as the front of the
ball is blocking light from falling on the back of the ball. This
suggests that the missing portion of the Moon is not visible because it
is in the Moon's own shadow, the front of the Moon blocking light from
falling on the back of the Moon. The Earth's shadow is not involved at
all, although many people explain the Moon's changing phases this way,
probably because they associate objects with casting shadows on nearby
surfaces rather than with objects blocking light from falling on the
backs of the objects themselves.

To move the ball in a way that replicates the changing phases of the
Moon one simply moves the ball around one's head while taking care not
to block the light falling on a "full" ball and to hold the ball in such
a way that it does not block light falling directly in one's eyes in the
"new" ball position. This replication here on Earth of what one sees in
the sky suggests that the cause of the changing phases of the Moon is
that the Moon is revolving around the Earth, not daily, but rather
during the many days that the phases are changing, in about a month.

The claim that the phases of the Moon are caused by the Moon revolving
around the Earth during about a month is supported by its power in
explaining two paradoxes. The Moon seems to be chasing the Sun daily
across the sky in the waxing phases, when seen by those of us on a daily
rotating Earth, as the Moon is revolving around the Earth through angles
0Â° to 180Â°. The Sun daily seems to be chasing the Moon when the Moon is
continuing to revolve around the Earth through angles 180Â° to 360Â° (or
from 180Â° back to 0 depending upon how one labels the angles). The Moon
appears to be moving east to west over several hours because the Earth
is rotating past it as the Earth rotates on its axis. The Moon appears
to be moving west to east over several days because the Moon actually IS
moving as it revolves around the Earth.

Eclipses occur when the Moon, Earth, and Sun are directly lined up in
the full Moon (lunar eclipse) and new Moon (solar eclipse) positions.
Eclipses do not occur every month because the Moon's orbit is inclined
about 5 degrees so usually the Moon is little above or a little below
the direct line of sight from the Sun.

The practices involved in developing these understandings included
questioning, observing, discussing, predicting, modeling, and
interpreting findings. Of particular importance was identifying
patterns, seeking ways to link cause and effect, and employing systems
thinking.

This section focuses upon observing seasonal differences in patterns of
stars that are visible at night, tracking details about the Sun's
apparent daily motion, and noticing seasonal differences in regional
climates. Interpreting these observations will be helpful inÂ developing
an explanatory model for the Earth's annual motion around the Sun as
well as for explaining why the Earth has seasons,

### **A. Noticing seasonal patterns in the night sky** {#chapter-047-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-about-the-sun-earth-and-stars.html#U5H320}

People who live where there are few lights at night typically are very
familiar with patterns of stars that are visible in the night sky and
with ways in which these change with the seasons. People who live in
cities typically are unaware of such patterns and their changes because
of the many artificial lights that brighten the night sky. Some star
patterns may be visible, however, if you look up on a clear night.
During this course, try to do this frequently!

##### ***Question 5.33 What seasonal patterns are evident in the constellations of stars visible at night?*** {#chapter-047-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-about-the-sun-earth-and-stars.html#U5H533}

-   Discuss with your group members any patterns of stars that you have
    noticed.
-   On a clear night go outside and look up! Enjoy what you can see and
    create your own patterns among the visible stars.
-   If interested in what others have envisioned when viewing the stars,
    go to a website such as
    <https://www.windows2universe.org/the_universe/Constellations/constnavi.html>Â Â or\
    <http://www.astronomy.com/observing/astro-for-kids/2008/03/learn-the-constellations>
    where you can read about the circumpolar constellations, those which
    are visible all year long, and about constellations only visible
    during different seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter) in the
    northern and southern hemispheres.
-   To access an interactive map of the sky that can display what you
    might see on a clear night in your location, go to
    [https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/interactive-sky-chart/](https://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/interactive-sky-chart).
    Click to open, enter your zipcode, year, month, day, and hour. To
    access names of bright stars, click the display option *Star Names*.
    To see traditional constellations, click on *Constellation lines*
    and later *Constellation names.*

Some constellations are visible in both the northern and southern
hemispheres although the southern hemisphere constellations may look
upside down from those shown below. Stars within a constellation look as
if they are near by one another as seen from Earth; however, they likely
are very distant from one another in space. In 1922, the International
Astronomical Union defined 88 official constellations,
([https://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations)).
Many of their names were derived from Greek and Roman mythology as shown
in the star chart for the northern hemisphere in Fig. 5.50. For a
similar star chart for the southern hemisphere see:

People of many cultures have seen a wide variety of patterns in the
stars. The Ojibwe People of Canada and northern United States, for
example, envisioned constellations based upon their own stories as shown
in the Ojibwe Sky Star Map at
<https://web.stcloudstate.edu/aslee/OJIBWEMAP/home.html>. This star map
shows Ojibwe constellations superimposed on those described in Greek and
Roman myths.

-   Different constellations are high in the night sky during different
    seasons of the year. During spring in the northern hemisphere or
    autumn in the southern hemisphere, for example, look for stars that
    seem to form a backwards question mark as shown in Fig. 5.51. These
    stars were seen as outlining the head and mane of Leo, a
    constellation representing a vicious lion fought by Hercules
    according to Greek and Roman mythology. The brightest star, Regulus,
    has the Latin name for king. Another bright star, Denebola, has an
    Arabic name for "lion's tail" (see:
    [https://africancosmosdiary.wordpress.com/tag/constellations/](https://africancosmosdiary.wordpress.com/tag/constellations)).
    Many cultures interpreted the changing patterns of stars high in the
    sky in terms of seasonal patterns in climate. Seeing the
    constellation Mishi Bizhiw, a mountain lion , high in the sky, for
    example, warned Ojibwe travelers not to trust thin ice on lakes as
    they moved from winter camp (See information about Mishi Bizhiw at
    <https://web.stcloudstate.edu/aslee/OJIBWEMAP/OjibweConstellationGuide.pdf>).

-   During summer in the northern hemisphere or winter in the southern
    hemisphere, look for stars high in the sky that seem to form a half
    circle near stars that seem to outline a human figure as shown in
    Fig. 5.52. In Greek and Roman mythology, Corona Borealis was a
    northern crown and Hercules was a hero. In 2013, the biggest super
    cluster of galaxies in the universe, the Hercules-Corona Borealis
    Great Wall, was discovered in the direction of these two
    constellations (see
    <https://www.space.com/33553-biggest-thing-universe.html>). The
    Ojibwe community saw this half circular star pattern as representing
    Madoodiswan, a sweat lodge, with a person nearby, Noondeshin
    Bemaadizid, a bather exhausted from the experience but renewed in
    strength and spirit. (See:
    <https://web.stcloudstate.edu/aslee/OJIBWEMAP/OjibweConstellationGuide.pdf>).

-   During fall in the northern hemisphere or spring in the southern
    hemisphere, look for stars that seem to form a square near stars
    that seem to outline a flying bird as shown in Fig. 5.53. In Greek
    and Roman mythology, Pegasus, was a winged horse and Cygnus, a swan.
    Telescopes looking in this direction have detected planets orbiting
    stars outside our solar system (See:
    [https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/231/hd-209458b/](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/resources/231/hd-209458b)).
    In Ojibwe mythology, Mooz was a moose, appreciated for providing
    food, clothing, and shelter. Ajiijaak was a crane, leading people to
    stay strong. (See:

-   During winter in the northern hemisphere or summer in the southern
    hemisphere, look for stars that seem to form a human figure with a
    belt as shown in Fig. 5.54. Orion was a great hunter in Greek
    mythology. Some stories envisioned Orion as followed by one of his
    dogs, Canis Minor, as he was raising a club and holding up a shield
    to fight Taurus, a charging bull (See:
    <http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/orion.htm>). Below the belt is
    M42, the Orion Nebula, where stars are being formed
    (<https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/messier-42-the-orion-nebula>).
    The Ojibwe community also envisioned a human-like figure,
    Biboonkeonini, the Wintermaker, with stars for shoulders and knees
    as well as three stars for a belt and long arms stretching to a
    bright star on either side (see:
    <https://web.stcloudstate.edu/aslee/OJIBWEMAP/OjibweConstellationGuide.pdf>).

: TABLE V.9 Developing central ideas about seasonal differences in
visible stars

### **B. Noticing seasonal patterns in sunlight and shadows** {#chapter-047-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-about-the-sun-earth-and-stars.html#U5H321}

In addition to seasonal differences in some of the stars visible
overhead at night, there are large seasonal differences during the day
in the lengths of shadows on the ground as well as in the Sun's apparent
motion across the sky.

##### ***Question 5.34 What seasonal patterns are evident in how the Sun seems to move across the sky?*** {#chapter-047-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-about-the-sun-earth-and-stars.html#U5H534}

#### *1. Interpreting changes in the Sun's maximum angular altitudeÂ Î±* {#chapter-047-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-about-the-sun-earth-and-stars.html#U5H434}

Section III.B. Question 5.8 explored how the Sun seems to move across
the sky by observing the shadows cast by a gnomon (person, post,
paperclip, or nail) perpendicular to the ground as shown in Figs. 5.9
and 5.13 (repeated below).

-   What do you wonder about such shadows?

Some aspects to consider include:

-   How do shadows change in size and orientation during morning, noon,
    and afternoon on a sunny day?
-   In what directions do the shadows point?
-   When during the day are shadows longest? When are shadows the
    shortest?
-   What happens during the year? How do shadows change in size and
    orientation throughout the day during different times of year?
-   How does the length of the shortest shadow during the day change
    with the seasons?
-   What is the connection between how long a shadow is and how high the
    Sun seems to be in the sky?

Now consider how the Sun seems to be moving. Â DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT
THE SUN!

-   What do you wonder about the Sun's apparent daily journey across the
    sky?

Here are some aspects to consider:

-   How does the Sun's highest altitude Î± seem to be changing over a
    week? Over several weeks?Â  Several months?
-   Does the Sun's apparent maximum angular altitude Î± seem to be
    getting higher? Lower?
-   Is the Sun ever directly overhead?

The angular altitude of the Sun, angle Î± (alpha), can be estimated by
measuring the height of a gnomon H and the length of its shadow L,
drawing a careful ray diagram and measuring the angle Î± with a
protractor or calculating the tangent H/L, and identifying the angle for
which that is the tangent as shown in Fig. 5.10 (repeated).

-   What differences have you noticed in what the Sun seems to be doing
    during the different seasons of the year. During this course, for
    example:
    -   Where has the Sun seemed to rise? (north of east? directly east?
        south of east?)
    -   What has been the apparent daily maximum height of the Sun above
        the horizon? (high, medium, low?)
    -   Where has the Sun seemed to set? (north of west? directly west?
        south of west?)
    -   What is the duration of daylight compared to darkness? (longer
        time period? about the same time period?Â  shorter time period?
-   Use the Internet or other source of information to identify the
    current dates in your location for the:
    -   spring equinox (equal number of hours of sunlight and darkness)
    -   summer solstice (longest number of hours of sunlight and
        shortest number of hours of darkness
    -   autumn equinox (equal numbers of hours of sunlight and darkness)
    -   winter solstice (shortest number of hours of daylight and
        longest number of hours of darkness)

    -   Where does the Sun seem to rise (north of east? east? south of
        east?) at this location on the spring equinox? summer solstice?
        autumn equinox? winter solstice?
    -   What is the maximum altitude of the Sun in the sky for this
        location on these dates?
    -   Where does the Sun seem to set (north of west? west? south of
        west?) at this location on these dates?
    -   What is the duration of daylight for this location on these
        dates?
    -   Create a table to report this information.
-   Summarize these seasonal effects for your location for the Sun's
    apparent:
    -   rising and setting times
    -   maximum height of the Sun's arc across the sky
    -   duration above the horizon

#### *3. Example of interpreting Internet data about changes in the Sun's apparent daily motion* {#chapter-047-developing-additional-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-about-the-sun-earth-and-stars.html#U5H436}

At [https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun),
enter Corvallis, Oregon, for example, in the search window for place or
country, click on the Sunrise & Sunset button, change the month to March
and current year, click on Go and click on a box in the row highlighted
for the date of the equinox. A report appears as shown in Fig. 5.56. The
green band indicates the start of daylight saving time at this location.

The report below predicts that on this spring equinox in Corvallis, the
Sun would appear to:

-   rise at 7:16 am, Pacific daylight saving time
-   rise almost directly east (specifically 89Â° east of north)
-   be highest in the sky at 1:20 pm time, Pacific daylight saving time
-   be at a maximum altitude of 45Â° above the horizon
-   set at 7:25 pm, Pacific daylight saving time
-   set almost directly west (specifically 271Â° west of north)

and that the duration of daylight would be about 12 hours.

:::
:::

As shown in Fig. 5.59, predictions for these events on a December
solstice in Corvallis, Oregon are for the Sun to appear to:

-   rise at a much later time, at 7:46 am Pacific standard time,
    (equivalent to 8:46 am, Pacific daylight saving time)
-   rise south of east (123Âº ESE),
-   have a much lower maximum altitude in the sky (22Âº) at about the
    same time, 12:11 pm, Pacific standard time, (equivalent to 1:11 pm
    Pacific daylight saving time),
-   set much earlier, 4:35 pm, (equivalent to 5:35 pm Pacific daylight
    saving time),
-   set south of west (237Âº WSW),

and that the duration of daylight would be much shorter, about 8 3/4
hours.

: Table V.11 Solar data for Corvallis, Oregon during equinoxes and
solstices

<div>

Â 

The data provided in Figs. 5.56 -- Fig. 5.59 and Table V.11 indicate
that at our location, the Sun's maximum altitude Î± (alpha) at the summer
solstice is about 69Âº, but only about 22Âº at the winter solstice, and in
between these, about 45Âº, at the spring and autumn equinoxes. What this
means is that the shortest shadows during a day also change in length,
being shortest at the summer solstice and longest at the winter solstice
as shown in Fig. 5.60.

The data in Table V.11 also indicate that at our location:

-   The Sun rises well North of East and sets well North of West at the
    summer solstice but rises well South of East and sets well South of
    West at the winter solstice, and in between these, rises in the East
    and sets in the West at the spring and autumn equinoxes.
-   The Sun is above the horizon for the most hours (15.5) at the summer
    solstice and the fewest hours at the winter solstice (8.75), and in
    between these, above the horizon the same number of hours (12) as
    below the horizon at the spring and autumn equinoxes.
-   During summer, the Sun's maximum altitude is higher, the Sun's rays
    shine down more directly through the atmosphere, and the duration of
    daylight is longer than during winter.

Ancient peoples erected monuments oriented to the solstices such as at
Maeshowe, built by Neolithic farmers about 5000 years ago on the Island
of Orkney in Scotland. This burial *cairn* is a large mound made of
stone, with a long low entrance passageway that is oriented so that
sunlight shines through it into the inner chamber only during a few days
before and after the winter solstice. (
<http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/maeshowe/solstice.htm>,
<http://www.orkneyjar.com/history/maeshowe/index.html>,
<http://www.maeshowe.co.uk>).

As shown in Fig. 5.61, ancient peoples also constructed large upright
stone monuments oriented toward the Sun and Moon, such as the Calanais
Standing Stones on the Island of Lewis, also in Scotland
(<https://stonesofwonder.com/callanis.htm>).

Recent droughts have led to new discoveries in Ireland of the remains of
ancient *henges*, circular structures that have become visible in fields
photographed from above by drones
([https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/drought-reveals-giant-4500-year-old-irish-henge-180969650/](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/drought-reveals-giant-4500-year-old-irish-henge-180969650)).

Several ancient henges in North America have been excavated in part of
the Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site located in Collinsville,
Illinois. Built about 900-1100 A,D, these henges were made with red
cedar posts about 15-20 inches in diameter and about 20 feet high. Some
aligned with the rising Sun during solstices and equinoxes.Â [See the

Modern people have chosen to celebrate astronomical solar equinoxes and
solstices in similar ways. In a project led by astronomer Judith Young,
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst has constructed a modern
standing stone circle (See:
<http://www.umass.edu/sunwheel/pages/whatis.html>) and
<http://www.umass.edu/sunwheel/images/sunwheel/paper.html>

The Southern Colorado Astronomical Society has created a standing stone
circle near Spanish Peaks in a project led by Russ Erganbright, a
retired engineer. They have carefully sited each stone to illustrate
where the Sun will rise and set during equinoxes and solstices. (See
[https://www.skyandtelescope.com/sky-and-telescope-magazine/beyond-the-printed-page/beyond-the-printed-page-a-modern-standing-stone-calendar/](https://www.skyandtelescope.com/sky-and-telescope-magazine/beyond-the-printed-page/beyond-the-printed-page-a-modern-standing-stone-calendar))

As shown in Fig. 5.62, Keppel Henge is a standing stone circle in a
garden in Ontario, Canada that was developed by Steve Irvine and Bill
Loney.

the apparent path of the Sun over a six-month period at the Keppel Henge
site. This photograph shows the changing height of the arc that the Sun
made as it appeared to move across the sky. The pinhole camera was a
coffee can with a pinhole on one side, attached to the trunk of a tree.

In summary, during summer in our location the Sun rises north of east
and sets north of west during the spring and summer; rises directly east
and sets directly west, during the equinoxes; and rises south of east
and sets south of west, during autumn and winter. The Sun appears to
rise earlier in the morning, to travel in a higher arc across the sky,
and to set later in the evening in the summer than in the winter. The
Sun's maximum angular altitude is about 69Âº on the summer solstice, 45Âº
on the equinoxes, and 22Âº on the winter solstice.

During summer the Sun is above the horizon for more hours and seems to
travel in a higher arc across the sky so that its rays shine more
directly down through the atmosphere. Therefore, more energy from the
Sun reaches the surface for a longer time period during the summer
compared to the amount of energy from the Sun reaching the surface
during winter. Our summers are warm and dry; our winters cool and wet.
This climate is typical for our region, the Pacific Northwest in the US.

For some world wide climate information, go to
<https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/dataset/monthly-climatic-data-world-data-tables>.

-   Summarize the seasonal changes that occur in your location for:
    -   when and where the Sun appears to rise
    -   how high the Sun appears to go in its arc across the sky
    -   when and where the Sun appears to set
    -   how long the Sun is above the horizon
    -   the average monthly temperature
    -   the average monthly precipitation

Complete entries in Table V.12. Then write a summary of what you have
learned about connections between seasonal differences in the details of
the Sun's apparent daily motion and in the typical temperature and

This section uses evidence of seasonal differences in developing two
explanatory models for seasonal patterns in the constellations visible
at night.

##### ***Question 5.36 Why are there seasonal patterns in the constellations visible at night?*** {#chapter-048-using-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-to-develop-two-explanatory-models-for-seasonal-patterns-in-the-constellations-visible-at-night.html#U5H536}

Just as there were geocentric and heliocentric models to explain day and
night, people have developed two explanatory models for the seasonal
patterns of the visible stars.

### **A. Using a geocentric model to explain the seasonal patterns of constellations** **visible at night** {#chapter-048-using-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-to-develop-two-explanatory-models-for-seasonal-patterns-in-the-constellations-visible-at-night.html#U5H323}

Using a fixed Earth, revolving Sun model, many ancient astronomers
considered the Sun, planets, and stars to be revolving daily around a
stationary Earth. They envisioned these entities as being located on
nesting *celestial spheres* centered on the Earth andÂ spinning daily on
their axes. The Sun also appeared to move annually with respect to the
stars along a path on its celestial sphere known as the *eclipticÂ *as
shown in Fig. 5.66.

:::

Because the Sun was so bright, it would outshine the stars near where it
was on the ecliptic. Therefore, people on Earth would see different
stars at different times of year, those opposite the Sun in its annual
path on the ecliptic around the Earth. These ancient astronomers
envisioned the Sun's path along the ecliptic as tipped at an angle to
the celestial sphere's equator. In this geocentric model, the
constellations appeared on an inclined band on the ecliptic of a
celestial sphere encircling the Earth as shown in Fig. 5.67. The band
was known as the *Zodiac* as shown in this illustration published in a
book by Regiomontanus about Ptolemy's *Almagest* in 1496.

As suggested by Copernicus in 1543 and Galileo in 1632, an alternative
explanatory model is that the Sun is not moving but it is the Earth that
is revolving around the Sun. Â Demonstrate this heliocentric model as
follows:

Â 

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black;padding: 5px"}
Equipment: Use a lamp without a shade, masking tape, 4 pieces of chart
paper, marker, and circular lid for each small group or student:

Place a lamp without a shade in the middle of a dark room. Use masking
tape to tape the cord to the floor to avoid having anyone trip over it.
On each of four large pieces of chart paper, draw a constellation to
represent one of the seasons such as those shown in Figs. 50-54. On each
wall of the room, tape a constellation representing spring, summer, fall
or winter night skies. Start by placing the constellation representing
summer on the wall that is in the north direction if you live in the
northern hemisphere or in the south direction if you live in the
southern hemisphere.
:::

-   Everyone stand in a circle around the lamp. How would you each model
    "midday"?
-   Next all model a rotating Earth by rotating in place,
    counter-clockwise if you live in the northern hemisphere, clockwise
    if you live in the southern hemisphere.
-   How would you each model "midnight"?
-   What constellation do you each see represented on the wall you are
    facing?\
    What constellations do colleagues see when facing other walls?
-   What constellation represents what is seen during each season?
    -   [What constellation is on the wall modeling what someone may see
        at midnight during spring?]{style="color: #999999"}
    -   [Â during summer?]{style="color: #999999"}
    -   [during autumn?]{style="color: #999999"}
    -   [during winter?]{style="color: #999999"}
-   If you live in the northern hemisphere, keep rotating while
    revolving around the lamp in a counter-clockwise direction.\
    If you live in the southern hemisphere, keep rotating while
    revolving around the lamp in a clockwise direction.
-   Stop in the midnight position occasionally and report what
    constellation you see on the wall you are facing.
-   Describe how this demonstrates a heliocentric model of the Earth's
    annual motion with respect to the Sun.
-   Sketch the circular path you and your classmates are following
    around the lamp
    -   as if you are looking down on this activity from above the lamp
    -   as if you are looking at this activity from the side, as if you
        are looking in on it from a window
-   Check the shape of your drawings by looking at a circular lid
    -   from above
    -   from the side

Resources in books and on the Internet frequently differ in the
perspective assumed in drawings of the Earth's orbit. As shown on the
left in Fig. 5.68, drawings from a perspective of looking down on the
solar system from above show an almost circular orbit. As shown on the
right in Fig. 5.68, drawings from a perspective looking at the orbit
from the side show an exaggerated elliptical shape.

##### ***Question 5.37 Why is it hot in the summer and cold in the winter?*** {#chapter-049-using-powerful-ideas-based-on-evidence-to-develop-an-explanatory-model-for-the-earths-seasons.html#U5H537 style="text-align: center;"}

An additional aspect of this heliocentric model is to envision the Earth
as tilted on its axis. The tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation has
profound implications for variations in climate as the Earth revolves in
its orbit around the Sun as shown in Fig. 5.69.

FIG. 5.69 Model of the Earth envisioned as tilted on its axis while
revolving counter-clockwise around the Sun, with seasons identified for
the northern hemisphere.
:::
:::

Note that the tilt is envisioned as always being in the same direction
throughout the Earth's annual trip around the Sun:

In the northern hemisphere, as shown in Fig. 5.69 for example, the Earth
is envisioned as moving in a counter-clockwise direction around the Sun
with the tilt is always in the same direction, toward the north star,
Polaris. In spring, the tilt is toward Polaris but opposite to the
counter-clockwise direction of motion around the Sun. In summer, the
tilt is still toward Polaris and now toward the Sun but perpendicular to
the counter-clockwise direction of motion. In autumn, the tilt is still
toward Polaris but also in the counter-clockwise direction of motion
around the Sun. In winter the tilt is still toward Polaris but away from
the Sun, perpendicular to the counter-clockwise direction of motion.

To model the revolution of the tilted rotating Earth around the Sun :

Â 

::: {style="border: 1pt solid black; padding: 5px; margin: 5px;"}
Equipment: Use a lamp without a shade, masking tape, four constellations
drawn on chart paper, and a globe representing the Earth. Â Place the
lamp without a shade in the middle of the room, with its cord taped to
the floor. Tape the four constellations representing spring, summer,
fall, and winter to the appropriate walls.
:::

-   Which wall is in the north direction? east? south? west?
-   Have someone hold the globe. Toward which wall should this person
    always tilt the axis of the globe?
-   Which season is being represented by where this person is standing
    with respect to the lamp, the tilted globe, and the designated wall?
    -   [Tilt backwards along the path around the lamp but toward the
        designated wall for spring]{style="color: #999999;"}
    -   [Tilt both toward the designated wall and the lamp for
        summer]{style="color: #999999;"}
    -   [Tilt forward along the path around the lamp and toward the
        designated wall for autumn]{style="color: #999999;"}
    -   [Tilt away from the lamp but toward the designated wall for
        winter]{style="color: #999999;"}
-   Â Have the person holding the globe keep the globe rotating on its
    axis and tilted toward the designated wall while walking around the
    lamp
-   Where should the person be standing to represent:
    -   the spring equinox?
    -   the summer solstice?
    -   the autumn equinox?
    -   the winter solstice?

as the person walks around the lamp, while keeping the rotating globe's
axis tilted toward the designated wall?

Now everyone model the tilted rotating Earth revolving around the Sun:

-   Tilt in the direction of the designated wall.
-   Practice modeling the Earth's daily rotation while tilted in this
    direction.
-   Which season are you modeling?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   -   Where are you with respect to the lamp and the constellations on
        the walls?
    -   Are you:
    -   tilted toward the designated wall but tilted backwards along the
        path around the lamp as you move forwards ? Â  Â (spring)
    -   tilted toward both the designated wall and the lamp? Â (summer)
    -   tilted toward the designated wall and forward along the path
        around the lamp ? Â (autumn)
    -   tilted toward the designated wall but away from the lamp but?
        (winter)

-   Now put the rotating and revolving motions together. As you revolve
    around the lamp, keep your body tilted toward the designated wall
    while rotating on that axis.

-   What is the connection between this model of a tilted rotating Earth
    revolving around the Sun and the evidence of changes in the Sun's
    maximum angular altitude Î± and the tilt's effect on seasonal changes
    in the climate?

-   Draw two diagrams, one representing a tilted Earth revolving around
    the Sun in an almost circular orbit and the other representing a
    lamp and students modeling the reasons for the Earth's seasons.

[The data reported in section VI.B.3 indicate that during summer the Sun
is above the horizon for more hours and seems to travel in a higher arc
across the sky so that its rays shine more directly down through the
atmosphere. Therefore, more energy from the Sun reaches the surface for
a longer time period during the summer compared to the amount of energy
from the Sun reaching the surface during
winter.]{style="text-indent: 2em;"}

In summary:

-   The Sun is higher in the sky when the Earth is in a position in its
    orbit where its axis is tilted toward the Sun during the summer
    solstice.
-   The Sun is lower in the sky when the Earth is in a position in its
    orbit on the other side of the Sun, where the Earth's axis is tilted
    away from the Sun during the winter solstice.
-   During spring and autumn equinoxes, the Earth's tilt is parallel to
    the direction of travel and the tilt does not affect the number of
    hours that the Sun is above or below the horizon.
-   Note that the Earth's axis of rotation always tilts in the same
    direction, in the northern hemisphere, for example, always toward
    Polaris, the North Star. What changes is where the Earth is in its
    orbit around the Sun.

Many people associate being warm with being close to a heat source and
being cold with being far away from a heat source. Thus it may seem
reasonable to associate summer with being closer to the Sun and winter
with being farther away. This is not the case here, however. The Sun is
about 100,000,000 miles away. The diameter of the Earth is only about
10,000 miles. The fractional difference in being on one side (tilted
toward) or the other side (tilted away) from the Sun is only
10,000/100,000,000Â  = 1/10,000. This is not enough to make a difference.

The northern and southern hemispheres are effectively the SAME distance
from the Sun; yet the southern hemisphere experiences winter while the
northern hemisphere is experiencing summer; the southern hemisphere
experiences summer while the northern hemisphere is experiencing winter.
The difference is caused by where the Earth is in its orbit around the
Sun and how this position affects the direction of the tilt of Earth's
axis of rotation with respect to the Sun, not by a very minor difference
in distance from the Sun.

Fig 5.69 assumes that the Earth's orbit around the Sun is circular. The
orbit is, however, slightly elliptical. This means that the northern
hemisphere is actually slightly closer to the Sun in January than in
July, the opposite of what one might expect.

Â 

How curious are you about the tilt of the Earth? This section provides a
detailed account of geometric arguments that underlie a surprisingly
simple way to estimate the tilt of the Earth's axis. The only equipment
you need would be a post and a way to measure its height and the length
of its shortest shadow during equinoxes and solstices. If you enjoy
puzzling through such geometrical arguments, read on. If not, perhaps
skim this briefly to see what is here and then go on to the next
section.

### **A. Developing and using mathematical representations** **to estimate the tilt of the Earth's axis** {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H326 style="text-align: center"}

Ancient peoples noticed seasonal changes in the lengths of shadows as
well as in the Sun's apparent path across the sky, particularly during
equinoxes and solstices. A Greek astronomer, Eratosthenes (276-195 BC),
for example, estimated the magnitude of the tilt by using such
observations and his knowledge of geometry.

##### ***Question 5.38 How can one estimate the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation?*** {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H538 style="text-align: center"}

This section develops a geometrical approach to estimating the tilt of
the Earth's axis of rotation. This approach is surprisingly simple:

-   Measure the maximum angular altitude of the Sun, angle Î± (alpha), at
    a given location during a solstice and during an equinox; then
    subtract one angle from the other.
-   Or measure the maximum angular altitude of the Sun, angle Î± (alpha),
    at a given location during both solstices; then subtract the angle
    during the winter solstice from the angle during the summer solstice
    and divide by two.
-   Or substitute (90Âº -- the latitude of the gnomon) for the maximum
    angular altitude of the sun at an equinox and use this along with
    the maximum altitude of the Sun at one of the solstices as indicated
    in the box below.

Estimating those angles involves simply using a protractor, consulting
data sources such as the tables presented in Figs. 5.56-5.59, or
measuring the height of the gnomon (a post) and the length of its shadow
at solar noon, dividing one by the other to find the angle's tangent,
and identifying the angle with a calculator or trigonometry table.

#### *1. Envisioning the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation* {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H438 style="text-align: center"}

The tilt of the Earth's axis is known as its *obliquityÂ *and is
represented by angle Îµ (the Greek letter epsilon). As shown in Fig.
5.70, the tilt is the angle Îµ between the Earth's axis of rotation,
which is represented by the large dashed line from the North Pole to the
South Pole, and the vertical axis, which is represented by the small
dashed vertical line. The vertical axis is perpendicular to the plane of
the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This discussion assumes the Earth is
spherical. The small dashed horizontal line represents the projection of
the orbital plane on this cross section of a spherical Earth.

#### *2. Estimating the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation* {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H439 style="text-align: center"}

How can you find out what the maximum angular angle of the Sun is at
your location during a solstice or equinox?

<div>

::: {.textbox}
To estimate the maximum angular angle of the Sun by observing a gnomon's
shadow, provide for each group:Â  a vertical post (a gnomon) in a flat
sunny area, chalk, straight stick, protractor, and if needed a meter
stick and trigonometry table or calculator with trig functions. Â Or use
measurements of the maximum angular altitude of the Sun for the
equinoxes and solstices at your location as reported in tables such as
those shown in Figs. 5.56 -- 5.59.
:::

</div>

-   Find a vertical post such as a fence post whose height you can
    measure and whose shadow is visible on flat ground during the middle
    of a sunny day. Or create such a gnomon by positioning a straight
    stick vertically in a flat sunny area.
-   Mark the tip of the gnomon's shadow on the ground frequently during
    the middle of the day. Local solar noon occurs at the moment of the
    gnomon's shortest shadow.

The maximum angular altitude of the Sun, angle Î±(alpha), varies as shown
in Fig. 5.71.

There are many ways to obtain values for the maximum angular altitude of
the Sun, angleÂ Î± (alpha), during the solstices and equinoxes at a
particular location:

-   Estimate the maximum angular altitude of the Sun, angle Î±, directly
    by placing a straight stick, representing a light ray, from the top
    of the gnomon to the tip of the shadow at local noon (time of
    shortest shadow) and use a protractor to estimate the angle Î± formed
    by the stick and the gnomon's shadow.
-   Or measure the height of the gnomon, H, and the length of its
    shadow, L, at solar noon. Â Then:
    -   Draw a careful ray diagram: First draw a line of length H
        representing the gnomon perpendicular to a line of length L
        representing the shadow. Next draw a straight line representing
        a light ray traveling from the tip of the line representing the
        gnomon to the end of the line representing the shadow. Then use
        a protractor to estimate the angle Î± formed by the lines
        representing the light ray and the shadow on the ground.
    -   Or calculate the tangent of angle Î±:

        estimate the angular altitude of the star Polaris on a clear

        points in the northern sky. (A star does not appear near where
        the Earth's axis points in the southern sky; this option for
        estimating a location's latitude is not available there.)

    #### *3. Nuances in developing and using mathematical representationsÂ to estimate the tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation* {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H440 style="text-align: center"}

    According to the heliocentric model, a nearly spherical Earth is
    revolving around the Sun each year in a nearly circular orbit that
    forms a plane. Diagrams representing the revolution of the Earth
    around the Sun can be confusing, however, because of the differing
    perspectives from which they are drawn.

    As shown in Fig. 5.73, the perspective of a diagram of the Earth's
    orbit around the Sun can be from above, looking down on a nearly
    circular orbit, or from the side, where the nearly circular orbit
    appears to be elliptical. Both of these diagrams are drawn from the
    perspective of the northern hemisphere where small arrows indicate
    the Earth to be orbiting counter-clockwise.

    The diagrams in Fig. 5.73 differ, however, in how they portray a
    tilted axis, either tilted to the left or to the right. The
    direction of the tilt is consistent, however, either always toward
    the left or always toward the right. The statement "the axis tilts
    toward the Sun during summer and away from the Sun during winter"
    does not mean that the Earth's axis is tilting back and forth. What
    is changing instead is where the Earth is in its orbit with respect
    to the Sun.

    The artist drew a circular orbit in the diagram on the left, from
    the perspective of a viewer looking down from above the solar
    system. The position for summer (A) is on the right, with the North
    Pole shown tilted toward the left, toward the Sun. The position for
    winter (C) is on the left, with the North Pole still tilted toward
    the left, but away from the Sun.

    The artist drew an apparently elliptical orbit in the diagram on the
    right, from the perspective of looking from the side, outside of the
    position labeled for fall. The position for summer is on the left,
    with the North Pole shown tilted toward the Sun on the right. The
    position for winter is on the right, with the North Pole tilted
    toward the right, away from the Sun.

    The perspective shown on the right is the perspective adopted in the
    solstice diagrams below. In the diagram for the summer solstice in
    the northern hemisphere, light rays come from the Sun on the right.
    In the diagram for the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere,
    light rays come from the Sun on the left.

    From this perspective, however, the Sun's rays during an equinox
    would be coming into or out of the plane of the paper and difficult
    to show in a diagram. Therefore, the perspective chosen for a
    diagram for an equinox is at right angles to those for the
    solstices.

    The gnomon casts a shadow of length L on the flat ground; the shadow
    is represented by the left part of the line perpendicular to the

    Rays of light from the Sun make an angle Î±~eÂ ~with the ground. Angle
    Î±~eÂ ~is the maximum angular altitude of the Sun during an equinox
    and its tangent is H/L at solar noon when L is the gnomon's shortest
    shadow.

    The rays of light from the Sun are coming from so far away that they
    are considered to be parallel. Therefore, the angle formed by the
    rays of light and the gnomon is equal to the latitude, angle
    ![\\phi](OEBPS/assets/3a81e631c53582650b6874ab5a371188.png "\phi"){.latex

    At our location in Corvallis, Oregon, the height of a gnomon and its
    shortest shadow on an equinox are about equal in length and the
    angular altitude of the Sun is about 45Âº, the value provided in the

    east, moves highest across the sky, sets the most north of west, and
    is above the horizon for the most hours.

    Angle Î±~s~, angle alpha during the summer solstice, is the maximum
    angular altitude of the Sun. This angle is formed by the shadow and
    rays from the Sun at solar noon on the summer solstice.

    Angle Î²~s~, angle beta during the summer solstice, is formed by the
    gnomon and rays from the Sun at solar noon on the solstice.

    Angle Î±~s~ + angle Î²~s~ = 90Â° because the gnomon forms a right angle
    with the flat area on which the shadow falls.

    Therefore, angle Î²~s~ = 90Â° -- angle Î±~s~

    The angle Î²~sÂ ~formed by the gnomon and the light rays is congruent
    with the angle Î²~sÂ ~formed by the red line to the center of the
    Earth from the point and the red line representing the horizontal
    axis. These angles are congruent because they are alternate interior
    angles formed by a transversal cutting across two parallel lines.

As claimed above in \#2, the angular tilt of the Earth, angle Îµ, can be
estimated simply by measuring the height of a gnomon (person, post,
upright stick...) and its shadow at solar noon during the summer
solstice and during the equinox, dividing the height of the gnomon by
the length of the shadow (H/L) for each observation, finding the angles
for which these numbers are the tangents, and subtracting the maximum
angular altitude of the Sun in the sky at the equinox from the maximum
angular altitude of the Sun in the sky at the summer solstice.

#### *6. Discussing the effect of the tilt of the Earth at several latitudes* {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H443 style="text-align: center"}

##### ***Question 5.41 What are the Tropic of Cancer, Arctic Circle, and Antarctic Circle?*** {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H541}

***Â ***The tilt of the Earth's axis of rotation causes unusual effects
at several latitudes known as the Tropic of Cancer near the equator, the
Arctic Circle near the North Pole, and the Antarctic Circle near the
South Pole.

As shown in Fig. 5.79, at latitude
![\\phi](OEBPS/assets/3a81e631c53582650b6874ab5a371188.png "\phi"){.latex
.mathjax} equal to angle Îµ above the equator at solar noon on the summer
solstice in the northern hemisphere, sunlight shines directly down on a
gnomon (a person, post, upright stick...) that casts no shadow. A long
red dashed line in Fig. 5.79 represents a projection of the Tropic of
Cancer, a line around the Earth at this latitude of about 23.4Â°, the
most northern latitude at which the Sun is ever directly overhead, where
Î±~s~= 90Â°. The Tropic of Cancer was named about 2000 years ago when the
Sun was perceived as being in the constellation with the Latin name for
crab (<https://www.space.com/16970-cancer-constellation.html>) in its
annual path along the zodiac in the geocentric model of the Sun
revolving around the Earth. The word *tropicÂ *is derived from a Greek
word for *turn*. After the summer solstice, the Sun appears to turn back
toward the south in where it appears to rise and set.

The Arctic Circle is the lowest latitude at which the Sun never seems to
set during the summer solstice in the northern hemisphere, where Î±~s~ =
0Â°. As shown in Fig. 5.79, this occurs at a latitude of an angle Îµ below
the North Pole, about 66.5Â° above the equator. A short red line with
thin dashes represents the projection of the Arctic Circle on this cross
section through the middle of a spherical Earth.

At this same time (June 19, 20, or 21) but known as the winter solstice
in the southern hemisphere, no sunlight reaches the South Pole or areas
within the latitude of an angle Îµ above the South Pole, about 66.5Â°
below the equator. A line around the Earth at this latitude, about
-66.5Â°, is known as the Antarctic Circle. A short red line with thick
dashes represents the projection of the Antarctic Circle on this cross
section through the middle of a spherical Earth in Fig. 5.79.

FIG. 5.79 Tropic of Cancer, Arctic Circle and Antarctic Circle during
the June solstice.
:::
:::

The diagrams in Figs. 5.74 and 5.79 can be puzzling in that both include
a point at which light rays shine directly on a gnomon at solar noon so
that the gnomon does not cast a shadow. Fig. 5.74 identifies this as a
point on the equator. Fig. 5.79 identifies this as a point at a latitude
angle Îµ above the equator, on the Tropic of Cancer. Both points appear
as if they lie half-way between the top and bottom of a circle
representing a cross section of a spherical Earth, a circle divided by a
horizontal line representing the projection of the equator in Fig. 5.74
and a circle divided by a horizontal line representing the projection of
the plane of the Earth's orbit around the Sun in Fig. 5.79.

The key to understanding this puzzle is to recognize that these diagrams
are drawn from two different perspectives that represent different
positions in the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Fig. 5.74 represents the
Earth in a position at an equinox. Â Fig. 5.79 represents the Earth in a
position at a solstice. It can be difficult to envision the difference
between these 3-dimensional perspectives as represented on these
2-dimensional diagrams.

Fig. 5.74 represents an equinox, when the Earth's tilt is not evident in
a cross section through the middle of a spherical Earth emerging from
the paper. The tilted axis is pointing along the direction of travel,
into or out of the plane of the paper, and only represented by a dot in
the center of the circle. Fig. 5.79 represents the summer solstice in
the northern hemisphere; the tilted axis is pointing perpendicular to
the direction of travel and visible as the inclined axis of rotation in
a cross section of a spherical Earth emerging from the plane of the
paper.

#### *7. Deriving the tilt of the Earth in terms of the difference between the maximum angular altitudes of the Sun during an equinox,Â *Î±~e~,Â *and during the winter solstice,Â *Î±~w~ {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H444 style="text-align: center"}

##### *Â * ***Question 5.42 Why does the tilt, angle Îµ = angle Î±~eÂ ~at equinox -- angle Î±~wÂ ~at winter solstice?*** {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H542 style="text-align: center"}

*Â *During the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere (December 20,
21, or 22), when the Earth's axis of rotation points away from the Sun,
the Earth is on the other side of the Sun from its position during the
June solstice shown above in Fig. 5.78. The light rays from the Sun come
in parallel from the opposite direction, as shown below in Fig. 5.80.
During the winter solstice at this location in the northern hemisphere,
the Sun rises the most south of east, moves the lowest across the sky,
sets the most south of west, and is above the horizon for less than 12
hours.

Envision a gnomon placed perpendicular to the surface, at a location
whose latitude is angle
![\\phi](OEBPS/assets/3a81e631c53582650b6874ab5a371188.png "\phi"){.latex
.mathjax}. In this case the Sun is at its smallest maximum angular
altitude at this latitude and the gnomon casts a long shadow as shown in
the gray line on the right part of the tangent to the surface of the
Earth at the gnomon's location as shown in Fig. 5.80. This figure is not
to scale.

The angle Î²~wÂ ~(angle beta during the winter solstice) is formed between
the ray from the Sun and the gnomon. This angle is equal to the angle
Î²~w~ formed by a line from the point to the center of the Earth and the
horizontal axis because they are alternate interior angles formed by a
transversal line intersecting with two parallel lines.

Both of these angles can be rewritten in terms of other angles:

Angle Î²~w~forms a right triangle with angle Î±~w~:

angle Î±~w~ + angle Î²~w~ = 90Â°;

Therefore: angle Î²~w~ = 90Â° -- angle Î±~w~

Â 

As claimed above in \#2, the angular tilt of the Earth can be estimated
simply by measuring the height of a gnomon (person, post, upright

during the equinox, dividing the height of the gnomon by the length of
the shadow (H/L) for each observation, finding the angles for which
these numbers are the tangents, and subtracting the maximum angular
altitude of the Sun in the sky at the winter solstice from the maximum
angular altitude of the Sun in the sky at the equinox.

Although a location's latitude is well known now, ancient astronomers
did not need this information if they were able to measure the maximum
angular altitude of the Sun, angle Î±, during both the summer and winter
solstices at the same location.

Add the equations from summer and winter solstices:

From \#5 above:Â angle Îµ = angle Î±~e~-- angle Î±~w~

From \#7 above:Â angle Îµ = angle Î±~s~-- angle Î±~e~

Â Â  Add: 2 (angle Îµ) = angle Î±~e~-- angle Î±~w~ + angle Î±~s~-- angle Î±~e~

:::

as claimed in \#2.Â  It is possible to estimate the tilt of the Earth,
angle Îµ (epsilon), by measuring the maximum angular altitude of the Sun
(angle alpha, Î±) during the summer and winter solstices at a particular
location, subtracting the maximum angular altitude of the Sun during the
summer solstice, angle Î±~s~, from the maximum angular altitude during
the winter solstice, angle Î±~w~, and dividing by 2. One does not need to
know the latitude of one's location! Â This may be the method that the
ancient Greek astronomer Eratosthenes used to estimate the tilt.

#### *9. Discussing additional effects of the tilt of the Earth's axis on several latitudes* {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H446 style="text-align: center"}

##### *Â * ***Question 5.44 What happens at the Tropic of Capricorn, Antarctic Circle, and Arctic Circle?*** {#chapter-050-estimating-the-tilt-of-the-earth.html#U5H544 style="text-align: center"}

As shown in Fig. 5.81, at solar noon on the summer solstice in the
southern hemisphere (December 20, 21, or 22), sunlight shines directly
down on a gnomon (a person, post, upright stick...) that casts no shadow
at a latitude that is an angle Îµ below the equator. A long red dashed
line in Fig. 5.81 represents a projection of the Tropic of Capricorn, a
line around the Earth at this latitude of about -- 23.4Â°. This is the
farthest south of the equator that the Sun is ever directly overhead.

The Tropic of Capricorn was named about 2000 years ago when the Sun was
perceived as being in the constellation with the Latin name for goat
horn
(<https://www.thoughtco.com/tropic-of-cancer-tropic-of-capricorn-3976951>)
in its annual path along the zodiac in the geocentric model of the Sun
revolving around the Earth.

The lowest latitude at which the Sun never seems to set during the
summer solstice in the southern hemisphere is called the Antarctic
Circle. As shown in Fig. 5.81, this occurs at a latitude of an angle Îµ
above the South Pole (about 66.5Â° below the equator). A short red line
with thick dashes represents the projection of the Antarctic Circle on
this cross section through the middle of a spherical Earth.

At this same time but known as the winter solstice in the northern
hemisphere, no sunlight reaches the North Pole or areas within the
latitude of an angle Îµ below the North Pole (about 66Â° above the
equator). A line around the Earth at this latitude is known as the
Arctic Circle. A short red line with thin dashes represents the
projection of the Arctic Circle on this cross section through the middle
of a spherical Earth in Fig. 5.81.

This section explores ways to visualize what happens as the Moon
revolves around the Earth while the Earth is revolving around the Sun.
Acting out such simultaneous motions can help make visible something
surprising about what is happening. Drawing diagrams and developing
mathematical representations can help answer intriguing questions that
emerge from such visual representations of the simultaneous motions of
the Moon and Earth.

-   Stand in pairs around the lamp representing the Sun. One person in

    -   To where should the person representing a full Moon move to
        represent the third quarter Moon position?

    the person representing the Moon model the simultaneous motions of
    the Moon revolving around the Earth while the Earth revolves around
    the Sun while rotating on its axis during one week between the
    Moon's full and third quarter phases.
-   If you see a third quarter Moon, where are you and everyone else on
    Earth heading next?

#### *2. Nuances in acting out the simultaneous motions of the Moon and the Earth* {#chapter-051-developing-and-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-an-intriguing-quantity.html#U5H448 style="text-align: center"}

This kinesthetic activity engages participants in using their own
motions to demonstrate what is happening. In particular, this activity
can help distinguish more clearly between the specific meanings of
*revolving,* in which one object orbits another object, and *rotating,*
in which an object spins on its own axis.

The Earth does not move very far during one week compared to its total
orbit around the Sun. There are about 52 weeks in one year, so the
distance that the person playing the role of the Earth should move would
be about 1/52 of the circumference of a circular orbit around the lamp.
This is not very far -- about a meter if the participants are moving in
a circle about 10 meters away from the lamp.Â  (Circumference/52 = 2ÏR/52
= 2\*3\*10 m/52 = a little over 1 meter.)

It is important to model accurately the direction of revolution and
rotation. In the northern hemisphere, the person representing the Earth
should **revolve***counterclockwise* around the lamp while **rotating**
seven times *counterclockwise* in order to model the Earth's motion
during one week of seven days.

To start in the full Moon position, the person playing the role of the
Moon should stand facing the person playing the role of the Earth in a
line with the lamp as shown in Fig. 5.82.

At the end of modeling the simultaneous motions of the Moon and the
Earth between full moon and third quarter moon phases, the "Moon" person
should be standing directly in the "Earth" person's direction of travel
around the lamp. The participants will have acted out a surprising
finding:

Â 

**When looking at a third quarter Moon, one is looking at the "place in
space" where everyone on the Earth will soon "be" as the Earth revolves
in its orbit around the Sun!**

Acting out these simultaneous motions of the Earth and Moon can enhance
students understanding of the difference between revolving and rotating
motions as well as of the phenomena being modeled. Some students may
remember the observations by a child visiting the southern hemisphere
(Figs. 5.36 and 5.37) and wonder about what direction students in the
opposite hemisphere would be revolving and rotating. Depending upon the
time available and the level of understanding evident in class,
exploring this issue may be feasible, particularly with a small group of
students who like to pursue details that deepen their understandings.

The Sun and Moon appear to rise in the east and set in the west in both
hemispheres. What is different is the direction one is looking when one
sees the Moon, which is orbiting roughly in the plane of the equator
(see Fig. 5.47).

In the northern hemisphere, the Sun and Moon appear mostly in the
southern sky. When one looks south, east is on the left and west is on
the right; therefore, both the Sun and Moon appear to move across the
sky from left (east) to right (west) in the *clockwise* direction, as
shown by the observation reported earlier in Fig. 5.8. In this case, the
term *clockwise* reflects a geocentric model, with the Sun appearing to
revolve daily around the Earth in a *left to right, clockwise* motion
across the sky. Acting out the simultaneous motions of the Earth and
Moon reflects a [heliocentric
model]{style="text-decoration: underline"}, however, with the lamp
representing a fixed Sun and with the "Moon" revolving a quarter turn
around the "Earth" and the "Earth" rotating seven times on an axis and
revolving a short distance around the lamp, all in a *counterclockwise*
direction.

In the southern hemisphere, the person representing the Earth should
**revolve***clockwise* around the lamp while **rotating** seven times
*clockwise* to model the Earth's motion during one week of seven days.
To start in the full Moon position, the person playing the role of the
Moon should stand facing the person playing the role of the Earth in a
line with the lamp as in Fig. 5.82

When modeling moving to the third quarter phase, the person playing the
role of the Moon should move *clockwise* around the "Earth" until
forming a right angle to the lamp. The "Moon" should continue facing the
"Earth" by also doing a quarter of a rotation while revolving.

As shown in FIG. 5.85, a student drew a sketch from the perspective of
someone in the northern hemisphere who is looking south to see the Moon,
with east on the left and west on the right. A third quarter moon is
shown high in the sky with the Sun rising in the east at about 6 am. Two
arrows represent the person forming a right angle by pointing one arm at
the Sun and the other arm at the Moon, which is approximately half lit
on the left.

FIG. 5.85 Student sketches of view of 3rd quarter Moon from Earth and
from space.
:::
:::

As shown on the right of Fig. 5.85, this student also drew a sketch of
an inferred view from space from the perspective of looking down on the
solar system from above. Dashes and arrows indicate the Earth revolving
counterclockwise in its orbit around the Sun and the Moon revolving
counterclockwise in its orbit around the Earth. The Moon, approximately
half lit on the side facing the Sun, is shown in the 3rd quarter
position, to the right of the Earth and located directly in the Earth's
orbit. If the Earth continues revolving counterclockwise around the Sun
as shown, how soon will the Earth "be" in the "place in space" where the
Moon "is" now?Â  The student wrote:

*Â The Earth will be headed to the point where the 3rd quarter moon is
currently in...space. The Earth has a counterclockwise rotation*
(although true, the appropriate word should be "revolution" here)
*meaning it is moving right. To achieve the appearance of the third
quarter moon, the moon has to be forming a 90-degree angle with Earth in
respect to the sun. The moon must also be on the right side of the Earth
as the left side of the moon appears lit by light from the sun.*

*Â * *A key concept needed to figure out how soon we will get there is
the relationship between position, motion, and speed. If one knows their
position, then they know the distance traveled and the amount of time it
took to travel that distance. Knowing this it is possible to figure out
how fast one got to that position or the speed they traveled...*

*Â * *The key relationship is the assumption that the speed of the time
it takes to make one full orbit around the sun is the same speed it
takes to travel from the earth's current position to the position of the
3rd quarter moon.*

*Â The speeds can be set equal because (*of the assumption that*) the
earth travels a constant speed when traveling its (*assumedÂ circular*)
orbit around the sun. The smaller journey is merely a section of that
larger journey, but maintains that constant speed.*

*This relationship between the speeds leads to the equality that the
distance of earth's orbit over the time it takes to complete earth's
full orbit is equal to the distance to the 3rd quarter moon over the
time it takes to reach the position of the 3rd quarter moon.*

*Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 
(*Edits added in parentheses*)*

As shown in FIG. 5.86, this student wrote, in both words and symbols,
the mathematics described above based on the assumption that the Earth
is moving with constant speed in a circular orbit so that the speed for
the total trip around the Sun is equal to the speed of the small trip
from where the Earth "is" to where the third quarter Moon "is" now:

FIG. 5.86 Student's estimate of time needed for the Earth to move to the
"place in space" where a third quarter Moon "is" now.
:::
:::

The total distance traveled around the Earth's assumed-to-be circular
orbit would be its circumference, 2ÏR; âx represents the small distance
traveled, the distance from where the Earth is and the "place in space"
where the Moon is "now."

The student used "Time of Earth's orbit" to refer to the duration of the
whole trip around the Sun and "Time to the 3rd Quarter moon" to refer to
the duration of the short trip. This general language use of the word
"time" can be separated into two distinct ideas: "duration" to refer to
how long a trip lasts and "clock-reading" to refer to a particular
instant, such as when a trip started or ended. In this case, "duration"
is the meaning intended. The student used a capital T, âT, to refer to
the duration of the entire trip around the Sun and a lower case t, ât,
to refer to the duration of the short trip from where the Earth "is" to
where the Moon "is" now.

Next the student solved this equation for the duration (ât) for the
small trip and substituted the estimated values provided. These had been
rounded to make the calculation easy without needing a calculator:

ât = ![\\frac{\\Delta T \\, \\bullet \\Delta x}{2 \\pi
R}](OEBPS/assets/3ada221bd4106dff92f580f7ac853c16.png "\frac{\Delta T \, \bullet \Delta x}{2 \pi R}"){.latex
.mathjax}

âtÂ  = ![\\frac{400 days \\, \\bullet 250,00 \\, \\text{miles}}{2 \\,
\\pi 100,000,000 \\,
\\text{miles}}](OEBPS/assets/1732f9731877dcf0fafe6ed6a266c62e.png "\frac{400 days \, \bullet 250,00 \, \text{miles}}{2 \, \pi 100,000,000 \, \text{miles}}"){.latex
.mathjax}

Then the student reduced this equation to:Â Â Â  ât = ![\\frac{1
day}{2\\pi}Â  Â =Â  Â  \\frac{1 day}{2\*3}Â  Â = \\frac{1
day}{6}](OEBPS/assets/43b7a5f914dff4ff0cc4577ce8c931d1.png "\frac{1 day}{2\pi}Â  Â =Â  Â  \frac{1 day}{2*3}Â  Â = \frac{1 day}{6}"){.latex
.mathjax}

and converted this to hours:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  ât =Â 
![\\frac{24 \\,
\\text{hours}}{6}](OEBPS/assets/ddbbecd195768b1e4acdd6793161b9db.png "\frac{24 \, \text{hours}}{6}"){.latex
.mathjax} = 4 hours

to obtain an estimate of about 4 hours for the time for the Earth to
move from where the Earth "is" to the "place in space" where the third
quarter Moon "is" now.

Finally, as shown in Fig. 5.87, the student reflected upon the
reasonableness of this answer:

*I believe this answer is reasonable because when creating another
equality which puts parts over wholes, it is equal. The equality is the
distance to the 3rd quarter moon over the distance of earth's rotation
(*should be *revolution)equal to amount of time it takes to reach the
3rd quarter moon over the amount of time it takes to complete the
earth's orbit around the sun. When all the values are substituted in as
they were for the original problem the values are equal to each other as
shown below.*

Physics Student, Winter 2018

Another student made sense of this answer in another way conceptually,
by figuring out how far the Earth travels around the Sun in an hour and
dividing that into the distance between the Earth and the Moon. This is
similar to finding out how much time a 300 mile trip will take if one is
traveling on a freeway at 60 miles/hour:Â Â  (300 miles)/(60 mile/hour) =
5 hours.

*I also did this problem using the distance the earth travels in a year,
which is 584 million miles, and divided by 365 days to find out how far
the earth travels in a day, I then divided this number by 24 to find out
how far it travels in a hour. With this number I divided 238,900 miles,
which is the distance to the moon, by the distance the earth travels in
an hour to determine how many hours it takes the earth to move into the
position of the moon. It was found that the earth takes about 4 hours to
travel the distance to the moon.*

This student apparently used some of the provided information, that the
Earth is 93,000,000 miles from the Sun, as well as the assumption of a
circular orbit, to estimate the total distance traveled around the Sun,
2ÏR, as 584,000,000 miles in one year of 365 days. The student next
divided these numbers to find the distance traveled in one day,
584,000,000 miles/365 days = 1,600,109 miles/day (wow!) and divided by
24 hours to find the Earth's orbital speed as 66,671 miles/hour. Then
the student divided this number into the distance traveled from the
Earth to the Moon: 238,900 miles/(66,671 miles/hour) = 3.58 hours.Â  So
about 4 hours is a reasonable answer, given the rounded numbers used.

Another way is to look up useful information on the Internet, such as
the speed of the Earth in its orbit
(<https://astrosociety.org/edu/publications/tnl/71/howfast.html> says
66,000 miles/hour), calculate how far the Earth would go at this speed
in four hours, and compare that to the given average distance from the
Earth to the Moon (238,000 miles).

(66,000 miles/hour)(4 hours)Â  = 265,000 miles. This is high compared to
the given average distance from the Earth to the Moon but close, given
the rounded numbers provided.

An additional way would be to figure out how many of the short distances
(from Earth to Moon) fit into the total distance around the Sun:

![\\frac{\\text{Total distance around the Sun}}{\\text{Distance from
Earth to Moon}} = \\frac{2 \\pi R}{\\Delta
x}](OEBPS/assets/4b1c391a4baac77360d818b90a2c74b0.png "\frac{\text{Total distance around the Sun}}{\text{Distance from Earth to Moon}} = \frac{2 \pi R}{\Delta x}"){.latex
.mathjax}

Multiply this by the time obtained (ât) and see if one gets a "year"

![\\frac{(2ÏR)(\\Delta t)}{\\Delta x} = \\Delta T \\, \\text{(works
symbolically if)} \\frac{2\\pi R}{\\Delta T} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta
t} \\text{is solved for}Â Â \\Delta

.mathjax}

Using the rounded values provided:

![\\frac{2 \\pi (100,000,000 \\, \\text{miles})}{250,000 \\,
\\text{miles}}](OEBPS/assets/13eda1339910e06e7de94249b44f593d.png "\frac{2 \pi (100,000,000 \, \text{miles})}{250,000 \, \text{miles}}"){.latex
.mathjax} (about 4 hours) = (2Ï 400 )(4 hours ) = 9600 hours

1 year = (about 400 days) (24 hours/day) = 9600 hours

#### *3. Nuances about working on this question* {#chapter-051-developing-and-using-mathematical-representations-to-estimate-an-intriguing-quantity.html#U5H451}

Another student drew the following sketches on the handout as shown in
Fig. 5.88:

FIG. 5.88 Another student's sketches for a third quarter moon as seen
from Earth and space.
:::
:::

Although the problem statement included the phrase "one morning," this
student drew the Sun in the "noon" position with a setting third quarter
Moon. "Noon" was the position suggested earlier for the Sun in the
tables shown in Fig. 5.42 and 5.43 that present views of the phases of
the moon as seen from Earth and from Space. The student also drew the
view from space in the same way as shown in that table.Â  The two views
presented together here in Fig. 5.88 nicely review the connection that
the angle formed by pointing one's arms at the Sun and Moon on Earth is
the same as the angle formed by the arrangement of the Sun, Earth, and
Moon in space.

The reason that this activity suggests sketching the view from Earth in
the morning rather than at noon is that this choice emphasizes that a
third quarter Moon is readily visible high in the sky at about 6 am, and
will continue to be visible throughout the morning if the sky is clear.
If one wants to see such a moon, morning is a good time to look! Also
our course meets during the morning, so if the sky is clear, the
students can go outside and see a third quarter Moon in the "place in
space" where they and everyone else on Earth soon will "be."

This activity also reviews the details expected in sketching such
diagrams. This student correctly drew the Sun and the Moon about the
same size as seen from Earth but with a large Sun, small Earth, and
smaller Moon as seen from space. In both diagrams the moon is shown half
lit, with the lit portion facing the Sun.Â  The view from space shows an
assumed circular orbit, with a large arrow indicating the
counterclockwise direction of the Earth's revolution around the Sun and
a small arrow indicating the Earth's movement toward the third quarter
Moon along this orbital path as seen from the northern hemisphere. The
arrow pointing from the Earth toward the Sun might be confusing,
however, if a viewer interpreted it as indicating a motion by the Earth
directly toward the Sun.

The format of the handout mirrors the problem-solving processes
advocated earlier in weeks 2 and 4 for pinhole math and thermal math
problems:

Describe a scenario in words\
Make a sketch of the situation\
Review any relevant central ideas that you know\
Draw a careful diagram if needed\
Represent the scenario mathematically\
State and justify an equation in words\
Define symbols and state the equation in symbols\
Solve for the unknown in symbols\
Record given values and estimate any needed\
Substitute values and calculate answer\
Check and reflect on answer

Checking an answer can take many forms; particularly encouraged is
seeking a conceptually different approach from that used for the
calculation. Such sense-making is more likely to suggest an alternative
approach if further thinking is needed.

This section explores several additional issues: how things move and
interact, what keeps the Moon and the Earth in their orbits, why the
oceans have tides, and what happens when objects fall here on Earth and
on the Moon?

### **A. Reviewing understandings about the Sun, Earth, Moon, and Stars** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H329 style="text-align: center"}

It may be helpful to step back and review before heading into new
territory. So far this course has developed the following understandings
about light and shadows as well as about the Sun, Earth, Moon, and
stars:

What causes shadows? Some shadows occur when an object blocks light and
casts a shadow behind it on something else. Other shadows occur when an
object blocks light from shining on its own back-side. If you stand
facing the Sun on a sunny day, for example, your shadow forms on the
ground or a wall behind you; a shadow also forms on your back because
your body blocks sunlight from shining there.

Why does it get dark at night? The Sun seems to rise in the morning,
move high across the sky during the day, and set in the evening. It gets
dark when the Sun appears to sink below the horizon in the western sky
and stays dark until the Sun appears to rise above the horizon again in
the eastern sky. According to this conceptual model, it gets dark at
night because the source of light, the Sun, has moved below the horizon
during its apparent daily journey revolving around the fixed Earth. This
Fixed Earth, Revolving Sun model is easy to envision and believe because
that is what one sees: the Sun, as well as the Moon and many stars,
seeming to move daily around a flat motionless Earth.

An alternative conceptual model, however, is that the Sun, Moon, and
stars only appear to be moving daily around the Earth; instead it is the
Earth that actually is moving, a spherical Earth rotating daily on its
axis. According to this conceptual model, it is day on the front side of
the spinning Earth, the side that is facing toward a fixed Sun; it is
night on the back side of the spinning Earth, the side that is facing
away from a fixed Sun. It gets dark at night because the back side of
the rotating Earth is in the Earth's own shadow. According to this
Rotating Earth, Fixed Sun model, the body of the Earth itself is
blocking the Sun's light from shining on the side of the Earth that is
facing away from the Sun.

The Rotating Earth, Fixed Sun model is not as easy to envision as the
Fixed Earth, Revolving Sun model. Acting out these two conceptual models
for explaining day and night, however, can clarify how these models are
alike and different. Also seeing a physical model can help, such as a
spinning globe near a lamp in a dark room, particularly if a tiny flag
or stick figure stuck to the globe represents a familiar location on the
rotating Earth. Understanding and accepting the Rotating Earth, Fixed
Sun model requires, however, more detailed observations and intricate
reasoning than simply seeing the Sun, Moon, and stars seem to move
across the sky on daily journeys revolving around the Earth.

Why does the Moon seem to have different shapes at different times?
During about a month, the Moon's shape seems to keep changing, with the
lit portion seeming to grow more and more lit until full and then
shrinking back to not being visible at all (see Fig. 5.22). Many people
believe that these changing phases of the Moon are caused by the shadow
of the Earth falling on the Moon. Such a conceptual model matches
experiences in which one often sees an object casting a shadow behind it
onto something else.

An alternative conceptual model is that the lit shape of the Moon
appears to change during about a month, as seen from Earth, because the
Moon is revolving around the Earth. The side of the Moon facing toward
the Sun is brightly lit by the Sun; the side of the Moon facing away
from the Sun is dark, in the Moon's own shadow. According to this
Revolving Moon model, the Moon's changing phases as seen from Earth
occur because different portions of the lit side are visible from Earth
as the Moon revolves around the Earth about once a month (See Figs. 5.42
and 5.43).

Envisioning the Revolving Moon model is easier if one plays with a ball
on a sunny day or in a dark room lit by a single lamp. The ball
represents the Moon, the Sun or lamp represents the Sun, and one's eyes
in one's head represent one's eyes here on the Earth. By holding up the
ball and moving it around one's head, one can replicate on the ball the
same pattern of changing phases one can see in the sky on the Moon: "new
ball" "waxing crescent ball" "first quarter ball" "waxing gibbous ball"
"full ball" "waning gibbous ball" "third quarter ball" and "waning
crescent ball" positions back to "new ball." Replicating with a ball
here on Earth the same sequence of phases of the Moon that one can see
in the sky suggests that these have the same cause: Â the Moon is
revolving around the Earth just as the ball is revolving around one's
head.

On-going observations of the Moon can reveal a paradox: Why does the
Moon seem to move east to west over several hours but west to east over
several days? (See Figs. 5.31 and 5.32.) One can infer that the Moon
appears to move from west to east over several days because the Moon
actually is moving that way while revolving around the Earth about once
a month. One also can infer that the Moon only appears to move daily
across the sky from east to west because it is the Earth that actually
is moving, spinning by the Moon while rotating daily on its axis. Thus
the resolution of this paradox uses and confirms one of the two models
developed earlier for explaining day and night, the Rotating Earth,
Fixed Sun model.

Why are some constellations of stars only visible during certain
seasons? Both ancient and current conceptual models assume that the
daytime sky is too bright for stars located in the same direction as the
Sun to be visible. According to the conceptual model used by many
ancient astronomers (Fixed Earth, Revolving Sun), stars revolve around
the Earth daily on a large crystalline sphere; the Sun revolves around
the Earth daily on a smaller sphere and also moves yearly along a path
with respect to the background sphere of the stars. The Sun's position
on this path, called the zodiac (See Fig. 5.67), determines which stars
would be visible, those not in the same direction as the Sun.

An alternative conceptual model is that some stars are only visible
during certain seasons because a rotating Earth revolves around the Sun.
The direction on Earth of facing away from the Sun determines which
stars one sees at night. These change as the Earth travels in its orbit
so that different constellations of stars are visible at different
times. This is based upon the currently accepted conceptual model of a
spherical Earth that rotates daily on its axis while revolving yearly
around the Sun.

### **B. Understanding motion** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H330 style="text-align: center"}

Scientific progress occurs through the processes just described of
making observations, developing possible explanatory models, and
thinking about which models together make the most sense. Typically new
questions emerge. If the Moon and the Earth are both moving, for
example, how does that happen?

##### ***Question 5.47 How are the Moon and the Earth moving?*** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H547 style="text-align: center"}

<div>

::: {.textbox}
To explore motion: each group uses a ball.
:::

</div>

-   Place the ball on the floor so that the ball is not moving.
-   Give the ball a push. How does the ball roll along the floor?
-   How can you change the ball's direction of motion while it is
    moving?
-   How can you make the ball move in a circle?

An English scientist, Sir Isaac Newton, studied motion in the late
1600's and early 1700's. He summarized his findings in a major work,
*Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica* published in Latin in
1687 and in English, translated by Andrew Motte, as *Mathematical
Principles of Natural Philosophy* in 1729.

Dibner Library of the History of Science and Technology, Smithsonian
Libraries.
:::
:::

The *Principia* included three books. Book 1 focused upon the motion of
bodies, Book 2 upon the motion of bodies in resisting mediums, and Book
3 on the system of the world. The contents of these volumes have deeply
influenced the development of science and society for more than three
centuries.

Near the beginning of Book 1, Newton stated *Axioms or Laws of Motion*,
including Law I:

**Law I**

*Every body perseveres in its state of rest, or of uniform motion in a
right line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces
impressed thereon.*

(Newton, trans. by Motte, 1729, Book I, *Axioms or Laws of Motion*)\
<https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/82>

According to Newton's First Law of Motion, an object at rest stays at
rest or if already in motion, keeps moving at the same speed in a
straight line, unless acted on by a force.

Newton's Second Law of Motion addressed what happens if a force acts on
a moving object: the object changes its speed and/or direction of
motion. If the Moon and the Earth are moving but not in straight lines,
what forces might be acting on them to cause their paths to curve?

### **C. Exploring forces** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H331 style="text-align: center"}

If one object affects another object in some way, there must be some
kind of an interaction happening between them. In physics, the word
*force* refers to an interaction between objects, such as pushing or
pulling on one another.

Exploring how things push or pull on one another here on Earth can
provide some experiences on which to base thinking about forces that
might be causing the Moon to revolve around the Earth and the Earth to
revolve around the Sun.

##### ***Question 5.48*** **What keeps the Moon and the Earth revolving in their orbits?** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H548 style="text-align: center"}

<div>

::: {.textbox}
To begin exploring force and motion, each group uses Â two magnets and a
small ball on a string.
:::

</div>

-   Discuss with your group members some experiences that you have had
    with things that are pushing or pulling on one another while:
    -   touching
    -   not touching
    -   moving
    -   not moving
-   Play with the two magnets. How do they interact?
-   Play with the ball on a string. How do the ball and the string
    interact if you swing the ball on the string around your head?

(Careful! Be sure you have enough space around you to swing the ball
without hitting anyone; also take care to swing without hitting
yourself.)

-   How would you describe the interaction between the Moon and the
    Earth as similar and/or different from the interactions:
    -   between the two magnets?
    -   between the ball and string when you are swinging the ball
        around your head?

If touching, two magnets may stick together and be hard to pull apart.
If brought near but not touching and then released, two magnets may
attract one another and move closer together. Or they may repel one
another and move farther apart. Such observations indicate that two
magnets can interact with one another even though they are not touching.

The interactions between the Moon and the Earth as well as between the
Earth and the Sun are similar to the interaction between the magnets in
that these bodies also are not touching. These are examples of forces
that *act at a distance* because the interactions occur without the
objects being close enough to touch one another.

The forces that two magnets exert on one another can be attractive or
repulsive in effect.

The interactions between the Moon and the Earth as well as between the
Earth and the Sun are different, however, in that these appear to be
only attractive effects; these bodies do not appear to be pushing one
another apart.

A ball being swung around one's head is pulled inward by the string,
which keeps the ball moving in the curved path of its orbit. The orbital
motion of the ball seems to be similar to the orbital motion of the
Moon. This suggests that there is a similar inward pull on the Moon by
the Earth that keeps the Moon moving in the curved path of its orbit.

This is called the *gravitational force **by** the Earth **on** the
Moon*. In the *Principia,* Newton expressed this as a Proposition and
Theorem:

PROPOSITION IV.Â  THEOREM IV.

*That the moon gravitates towards the earth, and by the force of gravity
is continually drawn off from a rectilinear motion, and retained in its
orbit.*

(Newton, trans. by Motte, 1729, Book III, Propositions)\
<https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/390>

Similarly there is an inward pull **by** the Sun **on** the Earth that
is keeping the Earth in its orbit. This is called the *gravitational
force **by** the Sun **on** the Earth*. When one object is revolving
around another, the gravitational force **by** the larger object **on**
the smaller object keeps the smaller object in its orbit.

These gravitational forces are similar to the string pulling inward on
the swinging ball. They differ from the force by the string on the ball,
however, in that these bodies are not touching one another; the
gravitational forces are acting at a distance without touching.

This conceptual model of a gravitational force pulling the Moon inward
toward the Earth as the Moon revolves around the Earth raises a new
issue: is this interaction between the Moon and the Earth mutual?

##### ***Question 5.49 If the Earth pulls on the Moon, does the Moon pull on the Earth?*** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H549}

-   Explore what happens here on Earth when two spring scales are pulled
    apart.

<div>

::: {.textbox}
To explore interacting forces, each group uses two spring scales. 10
Newton or 20 Newton Â scales are best.
:::

If you pull on a spring scale, it will measure the force with which you
are pulling, usually either in pounds or in Newtons. A Newton is a unit
of force in the metric system, named after Sir Isaac Newton. The front
of the device hides the spring. Spring scales work by stretching a
spring uniformly when the scale is pulled so that the indicator moves a
distance proportional to the force applied. As shown in Fig. 5.90 spring
scales may be circular or rectangular in shape.

-   Summarize your findings.

Among the laws of motion that Newton stated was Law III:

Law III

*To every Action there is always opposed an equal Reaction: or the
mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always equal and
directed to contrary parts.*

He provided an example:

*Whatever draws or presses another is as much drawn or pressed by that
other. If you press a stone with your finger, the finger is also pressed
by the stone...*

(Newton, trans. by Motte, 1729, Book I, *Axioms or Laws of Motion,* p.
83)\
<https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/82>

Newton realized that forces come in pairs; if you press on a stone, the
stone presses back with an equal force in the opposite direction.
SeeÂ (<http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Newt.html#ntcon>) for
additional discussion of Newton's three laws of motion.

As shown in Fig. 5.91, two spring scales pulled apart indicate that the
force **by** the left scale **on** the right scale is equal to the force
**by** the right scale on the left scale but in the opposite direction.

### **D. Developing and using mathematical** **representations of gravitational forces** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H332 style="text-align: center"}

In addition to formulating and articulating ways to use the three laws
of motion, Sir Isaac Newton also presented a detailed account of
interactions between bodies due to gravitational forces.

##### ***Question 5.50 What quantities determine the magnitude of gravitational forces?*** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H550}

In Book III of the *Principia,* Newton proposed that the Sun's
gravitational effect on keeping the Earth and other planets in their
orbits depends upon how far away they are:

PROPOSITION II.Â  THEOREM II.

*That the forces by which the primary planets are continually drawn off
from rectilinear motions, and retained in their proper orbits, tend to
the sun; and are reciprocally as the squares of the distance of the
places of those planets from the sun's center.*

(Newton, trans. by Motte, 1729, Book III, Propositions, p. 390)\
<https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/390>

Newton specified that this was a reciprocal relationship; the closer a
planet to the Sun, the bigger the gravitational force **by** the Sun
**on** the planet, keeping that planet in its orbit, and that
mathematically this was a function of the reciprocal of the distance
multiplied by itself (the distance squared).

In addition Newton proposed that a gravitational effect occurred with
all bodies in the universe and depended upon their masses:

PROPOSITION VII.Â  THEOREM VII.

*That there is a power of gravity tending to all bodies, proportional to
the several quantities of matter which they contain.*

(Newton, trans. by Motte, 1729, Book III, Propositions, p. 397)\
<https://archive.org/details/100878576/page/396>

Stated algebraically, this is known as Newton's Law of Universal
Gravitation, where the gravitational force (F) exerted **by** one mass
(M) **on** another mass (m) depends upon the size of the masses (M, m)
and the inverse square of the distance (r) between them:

![F =
\\frac{GMm}{r\^2}](OEBPS/assets/4dab4eadb408430b50140887f962df6d.png "F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}"){.latex
.mathjax}

where G is the Gravitational Constant, G = 6.67430 x
10^-11^![\\frac{Newton- \\,Â 
meters\^2}{kilograms\^2}](OEBPS/assets/2a24c5ffc29d5adaac1f27c1a90ffdd2.png "\frac{Newton- \,Â  meters^2}{kilograms^2}"){.latex
.mathjax}

This means that the gravitational force **by** Body A **on** Body B is
equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the gravitational force
**by** Body B **on** Body A.

This proposition has some startling implications. Not only does the
gravitational force by the mass of the Earth pull on the Moon, it pulls
on you as well! The gravitational force **by** the Earth **on** you is
what is holding you on the ground rather than floating in space. You are
pushing back **on** the Earth (the ground) with an equal and opposite
force! Not only that, but as you work together in class, you and your
group members also are pulling on each other with equal and opposite
gravitational forces (but not noticeably).

### **E. Explaining the ocean's tides** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H333 style="text-align: center"}

Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation suggests that the Moon is pulling
on the Earth with a force of the same magnitude as the Earth is pulling
on the Moon, although in the opposite direction. What evidence is there
that this is the case?

##### ***Question 5.50 What effect does the gravitational force [by]{style="text-decoration: underline"} the Moon have [on]{style="text-decoration: underline"} the Earth?*** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H551 style="text-align: center"}

People who walk on ocean beaches often notice how far waves are flowing
onto shore. People who work on boats tied up to docks often notice how
high the boats are floating compared to the height of the dock. This
sometimes varies by as much as 45 feet. (See:
<https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/education.html>) Many variables
affect tides such as a location's latitude, the shape of its shoreline,
shape of a bay and/or estuaries, nearby ocean currents, local winds and
weather.

By observing and recording daily tide levels, however, one can identify
patterns and make predictions for future dates. Detailed predictions
depend upon repeated measurements at a tide-monitoring station and upon
complex computer modeling of such data
(<http://oceanmotion.org/html/background/tides-observing.htm>)

As shown in Fig. 5.92, for example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) provides monthly predictions of the variation in
water level at the Yaquina Bay United States Coast Guard station in
Newport, Oregon.

-   Interpret this graph: What does the horizontal axis represent?Â What
    does the vertical axis represent?Â What does the line
    represent?Â Â What does the shape of the line represent?
-   Discuss with your group members how high and low tides are predicted
    to vary over this month at this tidal monitoring station:
-   When are high tides higher than usual and low tides lower than usual
    so that there is a big difference between high and low tides at this
    location?
-   When are the high tides not so high and the low tides not so low so
    that there is a smaller difference between high and low tides at
    this location?

(If you want to compare tide predictions with moon phases for a
different place or month, be sure to obtain the dates for phases of the
moon for that location. The Sun, Earth, and Moon are lined up at the
moment of full moon but the name of this moment depends upon a
location's longitude. The predicted time of full moon, for example, in
May 2020 is at 3:45 a.m. on May 7 in Newport, Oregon, but at 11:45 a.m.,
on May 7 universal time in Greenwich, England, and at 8:45 p.m. on May 7
in Melbourne, Australia. For dates and times of phases of the Moon at
different locations see
[https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases/](https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases)
. Enter your location and current date, record the predicted date for
the closest major phase of the moon (new, 1st quarter, full, third
quarter). For tidal predictions elsewhere, see
<https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/stations.html?type=Water+Levels>.)

Interpreted visually, the calendar for May 2020 at the Yaquina US Coast
Guard Station in Newport, Oregon, predicts the highest and lowest tides
near the middle to the end of the week of May 3, and somewhat varying
high and low tides near the middle to the end of the week of May 10. A
less visually salient pattern is evident during the weeks of May 17 and
May 24. Near the middle to the end of the week of May 17, the regular
pattern of very high and very low tides seems similar to near the middle
to the end of the week of May 7 although less extreme. Near the middle
to the end of the week of May 24, somewhat varying high and low tides
seem similar to near the middle to the end of the week of May Â 10.

First quarter, full, third quarter, new, and first quarter phases of the
Moon are predicted to occur during Thursdays or Fridays during late
April and May 2020 (see, for example,
<https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases/usa/newport-or?year=2020>.

A low tide with a negative height, -1.69 feet, is predicted at 6:56 a.m.
for May 7. This is a very low tide, lower than the average low tide for
a particular tide-monitoring station, which is typically set as the zero
point for that station. A minus tide means that tide pools usually under
water would be exposed and interesting to explore at low tide early on
this date.

To simplify looking for patterns, it sometimes helps to combine data
such as calculating average high tides for a given date, average low
tides for that date, and then the difference between the average high
and low tides as shown in Table V.15.

-   What patterns are evident when comparing particular phases of the
    Moon with:
    -   average predicted high tides
    -   average predicted low tides
    -   bigger differences between the average predicted high and low

    -   smaller differences between the average predicted high and low
        tides

at the Yaquina Coast Guard Station at Newport, Oregon, during the full,
third quarter, new, and first quarter phases of the Moon during May
2020?

: Table V.15 Average predicted high and low tides during the predicted
full, 3rd quarter, new, and 1st quarter phases of the Moon during May
2020 at the Yaquina Coast Guard Station, in Newport, Oregon

The average highest high tides and lowest low tides are predicted to
occur during the full and new moon phases during May 2020 in Newport.
The biggest differences between the average high and low tides are
predicted to occur during these full and new moon phases.

Smaller average high tides and bigger average low tides are predicted to
occur during third and first quarter moon phases during May 2020 in
Newport. The smallest differences between the average high and low tides
are predicted to occur during these third and first quarter phases.

These patterns connecting variations in the ocean's tides with the
phases of the Moon support the claim that a gravitational force **by**
the Moon **on** the Earth exists. A gravitational force **by** the Sun
also acts **on** the Earth's oceans and affects the tides, depending
upon how the Sun, Earth, and Moon are arranged in space.

##### ***Question 5.51 How do gravitational forces by the Moon and by the Sun on the Earth's oceans affect the tides?*** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H552 style="text-align: center"}

-   Draw the view from space, as in Fig. 5.38, for the arrangements of
    the Sun, Earth, and Moon for new, first quarter, full, and third
    quarter phases.
-   Discuss with your group members which of these arrangements would
    produce the most effect from gravitational forces **by** the Sun and
    **by** the Moon **on** the Earth's oceans. Which arrangements would
    affect the Earth's oceans the least?

As shown in Fig. 5.94, during the new and full moon phases, the Sun,
Earth, and Moon are arranged in a straight line, with the moon between
the Sun and Earth, or beyond the Earth:

Fig. 5.94 Arrangements of Sun, Earth, and Moon associated with maximum
high and low tides.
:::
:::

During new and full moon phases, the effects of the gravitational forces
**by** both the Sun and the Moon contribute to creating bulges of water
along this straight line. The gravitational force **by** the Sun and the
gravitational force **by** the Moon **on** the Earth's oceans are
directly in line during new and full Moon and therefore cause the
highest high tides and lowest low tides as the Earth rotates on its
axis. These are called *spring tides***,** not because they occur only
in the spring but because they can be considered as "springing forth"
during new and full moons. (For more information about spring tides see
<https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/springtide.html>)

As shown in Fig. 5.95, during first and third quarter phases, the Sun,
Earth, and Moon are arranged at right angles with Earth at the vertex,
as would be seen from above the solar system while looking down on the
northern hemisphere:

high and low tides.
:::
:::

During first and third quarter phases, the effect of the gravitational
force **by** the Sun **on** the Earth's oceans causes bulges of water in
one direction and the effect of the gravitational force **by** the Moon
**on** the Earth's oceans causes bulges of water at right angles so
these effects together produce smaller net bulges of water as the Earth
rotates on its axis. These are called *neap tides*, a term apparently
derived from an old English word for *narrow*. (For more information
about neap tides see:
<http://earthsky.org/earth/tides-and-the-pull-of-the-moon-and-sun#neap-tides>).

There are bulges of water on both sides of the Earth, which in most
places produce two daily high tides as the Earth rotates by a given
location. Explanations of the second bulge refer to the difference in
gravitational effects on opposite sides of the Earth and on the rigidity
of land masses such as continents versus fluidity of water. (see
<http://earthsky.org/earth/tides-and-the-pull-of-the-moon-and-sun>)

Additional variations in high and low tides occur due to variations in
the distances between the Earth and the Moon and between the Earth and
the Sun because the orbits of the Moon and of the Earth are not perfect
circles but ellipses. See
<http://astunit.com/astunit_tutorial.php?topic=tides> and

### **F**. **Exploring falling objects** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H334 style="text-align: center"}

One effect of the Earth's gravitational force on objects is that they
fall down if dropped.

##### ***Question 5.52 What happens when heavy and light objects are dropped from the same height at the same time?*** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H553 style="text-align: center"}

-   Respond to the following diagnostic question to document your
    initial knowledge about falling objects.

Falling Objects Diagnostic Question

Two balls are dropped from the same height at the same instant.Â  The
balls have the same diameter but different weights.

Which hits the ground first, the heavy ball or the light ball? Or do
they both land at the time?Â  Why?

#### ***2. Role playing Galileo's dialogue about falling objects*** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H453 style="text-align: center"}

A Greek philosopher, Aristotle Â (384--322Â BC), stated that heavier
objects fall faster than light objects. His ideas were influential for
about 2000 years. In 1638, an Italian scientist, Galileo Galilei, wrote
a dialogue in which three people discussed this question. In his
*Dialogue Concerning Two New Sciences*, Salviati, Sagredo, and Simplicio
have a conversation about this topic:

Excerpt from: Galileo GalileiÂ  (1638 /1914).Â  *Dialogue concerning two
new sciences.*Â  H. Crew & A. de Salvio (trans.), New York: Macmillan.

SALVIATI, SAGREDO AND SIMPLICIO are discussing motion:

::: {.helv}
SALV.Â  ...***I greatly doubt that Aristotle ever tested by experiment
whether it be true that two stones, one weighing ten times as much as
the other, if allowed to fall, at the same instant, from a height of,
say, 100 cubits, would so differ in speed that when the heavier had
reached the ground, the other would not have fallen more than 10
cubits.***

SIMP.Â  His language would seem to indicate that he had tried the
experiment, because he says: *We see the heavier;* now the word *see*
shows that he had made the experiment.

SAGR.Â  But I, Simplicio, who have made the test can assure you that a
cannon ball weighing one or two hundred pounds, or even more, will not
reach the ground by as much as a span ahead of a musket ball weighing
only half a pound, provided both are dropped from a height of 200
cubits.

SALV.Â  But, even without further experiment, it is possible to prove
clearly, by means of a short and conclusive argument, that a heavier
body does not move more rapidly than a lighter one provided both bodies
are of the same material and in short such as those mentioned by
Aristotle...

SALV**.Â ** If then we take two bodies whose natural speeds are
different, it is clear that on uniting the two, the more rapid one will
be partly retarded by the slower, and the slower will be somewhat
hastened by the swifter.Â  Do you not agree with me in this opinion?

SIMP.Â  You are unquestionably right.

SALV.Â  But if this is true, and if a large stone moves with a speed of,
say, eight while a smaller moves with a speed of four, then when they
are united, the system will move with a speed less than eight; but the
two stones when tied together make a stone larger than that which before
moved with a speed of eight.Â  Hence the heavier body moves with less
speed than the lighter; an effect which is contrary to your
supposition.Â  Thus you see how, from your assumption that the heavier
body moves more rapidly than the lighter one, I infer that the heavier
body moves more slowly.

SIMP.Â  I am all at sea because it appears to me that the smaller stone
when added to the larger increases its weight and by adding weight I do
not see how it can fail to increase its speed or, at least, not to
diminish it...

SALV.Â  ...but we have already concluded that when the small stone moves
more slowly it retards to some extent the speed of the larger, so that
the combination of the two, which is a heavier body than the larger of
the two stones, would move less rapidly, a conclusion which is contrary
to your hypothesis.Â  We infer therefore that large and small bodies move
with the same speed provided they are of the same specific gravity.

SIMP.Â  Your discussion is really admirable; yet I do not find it easy to
believe that a bird-shot falls as swiftly as a cannon ball.

SALV.Â  Why not say a grain of sand as rapidly as a grindstone? But,
Simplicio, I trust you will not follow the example of many others who
divert the discussion from its main intent and fasten upon some
statement of mine which lacks a hairsbreadth of the truth and, under
this hair, hide the fault of another which is as big as a ship's cable.Â 
Aristotle says that "an iron ball of one hundred pounds falling from a
height of one hundred cubits reaches the ground before a one-pound ball
has fallen a single cubit." I say that they arrive at the same time.Â 
You find, on making the experiment, that the larger outstrips the
smaller by two finger-breadths, that is, when the larger has reached the
ground, the other is short of it by two finger-breadths; now you would
not hide behind these two fingers the ninety-nine cubits of Aristotle,
nor would you mention my small error and at the same time pass over in
silence his very large one.
:::

Galileo's logical argument has three parts:

::: {.helv}
Salviati: "If then we take two bodies whose natural speeds are
different, it is clear that on uniting the two, the more rapid one will
be partly retarded by the slower, and the slower will be somewhat
hastened by the swifter."

(If tie two bodies together, they should fall slower because light one
drags the heavier back)

Salviati: ...the combination of the two, which is a heavier body than
the larger of the two stones, would move less rapidly, a conclusion
which is contrary to your hypothesis (that heavy bodies fall faster than
light bodies)

(If tie two bodies together, they should fall faster because combination
is heavier than heavy body)

Salviati: ... We infer therefore that large and small bodies move with
the same speed.

(The two tied together cannot fall both slower and faster than the heavy
body alone)
:::

Galileo apparently wrote about this question in dialogue format because
he did not feel free to write directly explaining his views as he was
already under house arrest for publishing a dialogue about whether the
Earth was the center of the universe or revolved around the Sun.

In 1543, Nicolaus Copernicus (1473-1543) published *De revolutionibus*
in which he proposed that the earth revolves around the sun rather than
the sun around the earth.

Ninety years later, in 1632, Galileo published *Dialogue on the Two
Chief World Systems: Ptolemaic and Copernican*. In 1633 Galileo was
tried for heresy by the Holy Office of the Inquisition of the Catholic
Church; *Dialogue* was prohibited. Galileo was forced to recant his
claim that the Earth was not the center of the universe, which he had
claimed based on his observations with a telescope that the moons of the
planet Jupiter revolved around Jupiter. He had used these observations
to support his claim that the Earth moved around the Sun. He was placed
under life-long house arrest. In 1638, his *Dialogue Concerning Two New
Sciences* was published in Holland. He died in 1642.

In 1979, Pope John Paul II called for theologians, scholars, historians,
to reexamine Galileo's case. In 1992, Pope John Paul II publicly
endorsed Galileo's support of the Copernican system, that the Earth
revolves around the sun

To explore what happens when a heavy object and a light object of the
same shape and size fall from the same height at the same time, each
group uses : two objects of similar shape, different masses (light and
heavy object about the same size and shape), board from which to drop
them, pad (rug, cardboard) on which they can fall, digital camera (cell
phone) with which to video their landing.
:::

</div>

-   Place two small objects with same shape but different masses on a
    board
-   Place a pad (rug or cardboard) on the floor
-   Hold the board high above the pad
-   Turn on a video camera focused on the pad
-   Tip the board so the two objects start falling at the same time from
    the same height
-   **Listen (and watch**) to see if they hit at different or the same
    time
-   What do you observe?

##### ***Question 5.53 Why do light and heavy objects fall the way they do?*** {#chapter-052-pondering-additional-issues.html#U5H554 style="text-align: center"}

<div>

::: {.textbox}
To explore what happens when one pushes a light object and a heavy
object, each small group uses light and heavy objects of similar shapes
and sizes such as a heavy block made of wood, brick, or concrete and a
light block made of Styrofoam, both covered with duck-tape so that they
appear the same when sitting at rest on a flat table top
:::

</div>

-   Place both blocks on a table top:

Invite each member of the group to push both blocks at the same time

-   Which block is harder to get moving? Why?

The inference is that although the Earth pulls harder on the heavier
object, the heavier object is also harder to get going; it has a bigger
*inertia*. This means that the objects accelerate at the same rate when
falling toward the Earth as long as they do not encounter differences
from air resistance as they fall. A person with a parachute falls slower
that the person would without a parachute, for example, because of the
role of air resistance in slowing the parachute's fall.

Note that Sir Isaac Newton was apparently sitting under an apple tree
while admiring a moon in the sky. He is said to have had the insight
there that the moon was "falling" toward the earth in the same way that
an apple from the tree was falling to the Earth, both being pulled
toward the center of the Earth by a gravitational force by the Earth. As
shown in Fig. 5.96, an object shot out of a canon at various velocities
might fall to the Earth near the canon, fall farther from the canon,
'fall' into a circular orbit around the Earth, 'fall' into an elliptical
orbit around the Earth, or 'fall' away from the Earth into
space.(<http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/Newtons-theory-of-gravity.html>)

This section completes this unit. As an informed citizen in your
community, you should become aware of the local standards for teaching
science, particularly if you are a teacher, preparing to become a
teacher, or a parent advocating for more science to be taught in
elementary schools.

##### ***Question 5.57 What are the current standards for teaching scienceÂ at various grade levels where you live?*** {#chapter-053-xii-making-connections-to-educational-policies.html#U5H557 style="text-align: center"}

-   Contact your local department of education to find out about current
    standards for teaching science at various grade levels in your area.
    The Oregon Department of Education's announcement, for example, is
    atÂ <http://www.oregon.gov/ode/educator-resources/standards/science/Pages/Science-Standards.aspx>
    . This state has adopted the *Next Generation Science Standards
    (NGSS Lead States, 2013,* <https://www.nextgenscience.org>.) These
    standards recommend *disciplinary core ideas,science and engineering
    practices*Â and *crosscutting concepts* that students should learn
    and use at various grade levels.

##### Q***uestion 5.58 Â How would you use your community's standards for teaching scienceÂ to engage children in learning about astronomical phenomena within the Sun/Earth/Moon system?*** {style="text-align: left"}

**A. Learning more about the USÂ *Next Generation Science Standards***

-   Briefly review the following:
    -   *Disciplinary Core Ideas* about Earth and Space Sciences,
        particularly pages 380-381 at
        <https://www.nap.edu/read/18290/chapter/11>,
    -   the eight recommended *Scientific and Engineering Practices* at
        <https://www.nap.edu/read/18290/chapter/12> ,
    -   the seven *Crosscutting Concepts* recommended for emphasis at
        <https://www.nap.edu/read/18290/chapter/13> .
-   For each of the three dimensions being advocated, indicate at least
    one element that seems most of interest to you. Why?

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Discuss an example of ways in which you might engage children of the
    age you want to teach in learning about earth and space science by
    developing a disciplinary core idea, using at least one of the
    science and engineering practices and one of the crosscutting
    concepts that are of interest to you. Or discuss an example drawn
    from the aspects indicated in Table V.17 below.

### **B. Reflecting upon watching the sky**

Nothing needs to be bought or assembled to engage children anywhere on
Earth in learning about the Earth's Moon. All one needs is the time and
intention to look up at the sky whenever the Moon is visible. A class
field trip to the school's playground, a brief conversation while the
children line up to come in from Â recess, a greeting as students enter
or leave the building all are venues within which one can teach about
the Moon and its relation to the Sun when both are visible in the sky
during school hours. Also engaging families in watching the Moon
together at home can be an effective way to establish a positive
home/school connection. It is important, however, to warn students and
their families to protect their eyes by never looking directly at the
Sun!

Students observed and developed understandings about the Moon and the
Sun throughout the course. They began by responding to diagnostic
questions that recorded their initial ideas about why it gets dark at
night, why it is cold in the winter and hot in the summer, and why the
moon seems to have different shapes at different times. They also
recorded observations of the Moon and the Sun during class and at home
during the first four weeks, identified patterns in their observations,
used these patterns to predict when each phase of the Moon appears to
rise, transit, and set, and responded to homework and a midterm question
that focused on what they had observed but did not yet ask them to
explain the phenomena observed.

After the midterm, students developed explanatory models for day and
night, the phases of the Moon, and the Earth's seasons. Typically about
a third of the students experience major changes in their understandings
about the Sun/Earth/Moon system. These include that the dark part of the
changing phases of the Moon is caused by the Moon's own shadow rather
than the shadow of the Earth and that the Earth's seasons are caused by
the tilt of the Earth's axis as the Earth revolves around the Sun rather
than by how close or far the Earth is to the Sun. When time permits,
students also consider the role of gravitational forces in the Moon's
orbital motion around the Earth and in causing the Earth's tides.

Acting out the inferred motions of the Moon around the Earth while the
Earth moves around the Sun can lead to a surprising inference: when one
is looking at a third quarter Moon, one is looking at the "place in
space" where everyone on Earth is heading next during the Earth'sÂ orbit
around the Sun! How soon will we all get there? An estimate of about 3.5
hours emerges fromÂ using the assumption of circular orbits, relevant
mathematics, and information about the distance between the Earth and
the Moon as well as the distance between the Earth and the Sun! (When
looking at a first quarter Moon, the inference is that one is looking at
the "place in space" where all of us on Earth have just been!)

Making observations and consulting Internet resources provided evidence
for which constellations of stars are visible during which seasons. Such
evidence provides support for the inference that the Earth revolves
around the Sun each year rather than that the Sun revolves around the
Earth each day. Making observations and consulting Internet resources
also provided evidence for where along the horizon the Sun appears to
rise and set, how the length and direction of a gnomon's shadow changes
during a sunny day, and how high above the horizon the Sun transits as
it seems to move across the sky. Such evidence supported the inference
that the Earth rotates on a tilted axis as the Earth revolves around the
Sun.

An important aspect of this model is that the tilt is always in the same
direction throughout the Earth's journey around the Sun. The northern
and southern hemispheres experience the effects of this tilt, however,
in opposite ways. When one hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, the
other hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun.

This complex model explains that hot summers occur during the Earth's
revolution around the Sun when a hemisphere's tilt is toward the Sun so
that the Sun is high in the sky at local noon, shines more directly down
through the atmosphere, and is visible above the horizon for more hours
than not visible below. Cold winters occur during the Earth's revolution
around the Sun when a hemisphere's tilt is away from the Sun so that the
Sun is low in the sky at local noon, shines at more of an angle through
the atmosphere, and is visible above the horizon for fewer hours than
not visible below.

During spring and fall, neither hemisphere is tilted toward or away from
the Sun: one hemisphere is tilted toward the direction of the Earth's
motion around the Sun; the other hemisphere is tilted away from the
Earth's direction of motion around the Sun. Acting out these aspects of
the Earth's revolution around the Sun, by leaning always in the same
direction while revolving around a lamp in a dark room, can be both
challenging and fun for students, whether children or adults.

The unit closes by making connections to educational policies as
articulated in the US *Next Generation Science Standards* (NGSS, Lead
States, 2013). As a last homework or question on the final, students use
their initial and later responses to the diagnostic questions as
evidence for reflecting upon what and how they learned about the
Sun/Earth/Moon system during this course.

### **C. Making connections to NGSS understandings about the nature of scienc*e***

TheÂ *Next Generation Science Standards (*NGSS Lead States,
2013*)Â *recommends that students engage in three dimensions of learning
science by using *science and engineering practices* and c*ross cutting
concepts* while learning *disciplinary core ideas*. In this unit, for
example, developing explanatory models for day and night, the phases of
the Moon, and the Earth's seasons are examples of the NGSS science and
engineering practice of *constructing explanations*. Constructing such
evidence-based accounts of natural phenomena also exemplifies the
crosscutting concept of *identifying patterns* while learning
*disciplinary core ideas* about the *Earth and the solar system*.

Children in grades K-2, for example, should learn that *patterns of
movement of the sun, moon, and stars as seen from Earth can be observed,
described, and predicted.* During this unit, students predicted rising,
transiting, and setting times for each phase of the Moon by interpreting
their observations of the shape of the lit portion of the Moon and the
angle formed by their arms when pointing at the Sun and Moon if both
were visible,

This unit also has provided many examples of the nature of science as
articulated in Appendix H of theÂ *Next Generation Science
StandardsÂ *(NGSS, Lead States,
2013)Â <https://www.nextgenscience.org/resources/ngss-appendices> .
Appendix H includes tables that provide insights about the development
of these understandings about the nature of science across grade spans
of K-2, 3-5 (elementary), 6-8 (middle school), and 9-12 (high school).

That *scientific knowledge is based on empirical evidence,* for example,
is emphasized throughout this course. Unit 5 models NGSS recommendations
that children in grades K-2 learn thatÂ *scientists look for patterns and
order when making observations about the world,* thatÂ upper elementary
students in grades 3-5 learn thatÂ *science findings are based on
recognizing patterns,* that middle school students in grades 6-8 learn
thatÂ *science knowledge is based upon logical and conceptual connections
between evidence and explanations,* and that students in grades 9-12 in
high school learn that *science arguments are strengthened by multiple
lines of evidence supporting a single explanation.*

That *scientific knowledge assumes an order and consistency in natural
systems* is key to understanding, for example, the cause of the phases
of the Moon. By observing the Moon during the first four weeks of the
course, the students documented how the shape of the lit portion of the
Moon seemed to change. Next, if the Moon were visible during class, they
could go outside, each hold a ball up next to the Moon in the sky, and
see that the portion of theirÂ [balls]{.ul}Â lit by the Sun matched the
lit portion of the [Moon]{.ul}Â in the sky (or if inside a dark room with
a single lamp, they could each hold up a ball so that its lit portion
would match the shape of the lit portion of the Moon they expected to
see in the sky that day if the Moon were visible). Then by moving their
balls around their heads, they also could make the changing shape of the
lit portion of theirÂ [balls]{.ul}Â match the same changing shape of the
[Moon]{.ul}Â they had been observing in the sky. Finally, they used the
understanding that the *basic laws of nature are the same everywhere in
the universe* (grades 3-5) to infer that the changing phases of the Moon
they had seen in the sky were caused by the Moon revolving around the
Earth just as the changing phases of their balls were caused by moving
their balls around their heads.

This unit illustrated that *scientific knowledge is open to revision in
light of new evidence*Â in several ways. When considering two explanatory
models for day and night, for example, an obvious model is that the Sun
revolves daily around the Earth. This is what students can infer when
they compare the Sun's changes in position in the sky over several
hours. This geocentric model also is embedded in our language with
descriptions of sunrise and sunset as well as in tools such as analogue
clocks, whose hands sweep clockwise in a circle, like the Sun's apparent
daily rising, moving high across the sky, and setting when viewed from
the northern hemisphere.

Some students initially answer the question, "why does it get dark at
night?" with a version of the "the sun goes down". The alternative model
is much harder to envision, of an Earth rotating daily on its axis so
that the side of the Earth facing away from the Sun is in the Earth's
own shadow. Seeing the model of a spinning globe in a dark room lit by a
single lamp helps; in this course, an argument based on evidence occurs
in resolving a paradox. After observing the Moon for several weeks,
students start to notice that the Moon seems to move daily from east to
west during several hours, like the Sun, but also from west to east
during several days. They can explain this paradox by understanding that
the Earth's daily rotation on its axis causes the apparent east to west
daily motion of the Moon whereas the apparent west to east motion of the
Moon over several days occurs because the Moon actually is moving that
way as it revolves around the Earth.

Such complex reasoning, based on logic and evidence, is an example of
the way scientists gain confidence in one model versus another in their
explorations of the natural world. One goal of this course has been to
foster such understandings of the nature of science in a context that is
familiar and accessible to all.
